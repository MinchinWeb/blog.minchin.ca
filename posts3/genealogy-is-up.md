Many years ago when I first bought [minchin.ca](http://minchin.ca/), I
thought it would be neat to put my genealogy online. This stemed, in
part, from the fact that most of the genealogy research I was doing was
online. But it's taken a long time to figure out how to generate the
webpages a way I wanted. I wanted a website that I could update without
the links changing, and a way to hide the information about living
people. Just this last week I found
[Adam](http://timforsythe.com/tools/adam), an online service hosted by
Tim Forsythe, that will do that for me. So now my genealogy is up! Check
it out at
[minchin.ca/genealogy/](http://www.minchin.ca/genealogy/index.html).\

My genealogy remains a work in progress. If there are mistakes, let me
know so I can fix them. If we're related and long lost cousins, I'd love
to hear from you!
