While much has been written about Facebook, this isn't about how

Facebook as a website or a company has changed, but rather how my

relationship with it has changed. I am particularly inspired to write

this this morning after reading [this
article](http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/02/how-we-ruin-social-networks-facebook-specifically/)
by Cassey Johnston in Ars Technica.\

\

It

sounds like Cassey got on Facebook a little before me. I remember the

announcement that Facebook would accept anyone with a .edu email

address. Seeing as [only American schools could get .edu
domains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.edu),

this became another case of "only the Americans get cool tech toys" (a

far too common problem when living in Canada). It was maybe a year later

that Facebook opened up to "foreign" universities. This would have been

about 2006. At first I ignored it - I felt like I could keep track of

my friends well enough through email and MSN Messenger. I eventually

joined because I got an invite from a friend (Isaac) who was otherwise

MIA.\

\

The first bit was fun. I'd become friends with

someone on Facebook, sift through their friends list to find more people

I knew, and invite them to be my 'friend.' Lather, Rinse, Repeat. I

joined March 27, 2007, and become 'friends' with 14 people that first

day. My Facebook friends were people I saw frequently in real life, or

wished I did, and so I had no problem sharing my thoughts and photos of

my activities with them. No, I didn't share my "deepest, darkest

secrets", but the sort of things I'd share with a friend at a party -

personal triumphs, reflections on life, half formed ideas, and the like.

And I ended up at a number of cool parties that I was welcome to

attend, but had not been personally invited to, because 'everyone will

see it on Facebook.'\

\

But then something changed. Part

of it was Facebook, part of it was me. The biggest change on the

Facebook side was the change from a sort of 'private club' to a publicly

available repertoire tied to my name. I did what I could to keep my

profile locked down and out of (Google) sight, but I no longer trusted

Facebook really wanted to keep anything private I didn't want shared

with the world, and Facebook was just waiting for me to mess up or

ignore some change in policy to make everything on my profile visible to

the world.\

\

I wasn't worried about people finding me

via Google, but rather those people (particularly potential employers)

making a snap judgement based on a five-year-old photo taken out of

context. And this wasn't a hypothetical concern because I'd done it.

When trying to find a job, I'd be writing a cover letter and trying to

determine whether to address "Jamie" as 'Mr.' or 'Mrs.' and so to Google

I would go. In the first page of results would be their (public)

Facebook profile which would have their profile picture (solving the

'Mr' or 'Mrs' questions), but also pictures of their wife and two kids,

plus the high school they went to and the year they graduated, and

sometimes pictures of their last holiday in Mexico. Creepy.\

\

On

my own side, I grew up a little and life changed. I started seriously

dating, and then got engaged and then married. As our relationship

progressed and we started spending more and more time together, my need

for Facebook decreased. I was less interested in going to parties to

meet people. Facebook was useless as a list of possible dates. And I

didn't need Facebook to communicate with my date. And when engaged and

first married, your interest in the outsider world drops considerably.\

\

So,

like many other users, Facebook does seem like either "a chore or a

timesink," depending on the day. The biggest reason I keep it is because

it's easier that trying to keep an email list for 400 up-to-date and

makes communication relatively painless for me and my Facebook

'friends.' Things that I want to say and have permanence, I post

elsewhere, like here on my blog, which is older than my Facebook

profile.\

\

Over time, how I've used Facebook has changed

many times. Will it change again, and what will that mean? I'm not sure;

only time will tell....
