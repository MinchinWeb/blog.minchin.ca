Catholic churches are everywhere in France. After seeing several dozen,
I started to feel like I'd seen most of what there was to see. And then
I would wander into some random church and discover another gem. In many
of the churches, the stained glass was exquisite. Sometimes I could read
the story in the windows and other times I just wondered who all the
saints could be. This is a window I quite liked; I enjoyed how it
depicted Jesus Christ, the "Lamb of God."\
