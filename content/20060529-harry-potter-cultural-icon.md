It's interesting how much Harry Potter -- the fictional wizard boy that
every kid has read about and made J.K. Rowling an instant millionarie --
has become so much of our culture. This is well illustrated by a quote
from the latest book my sister, also a Harry Potter fan, picked up. This
book, also well known, is Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code".

Leading up this point, Langdon (the professor, our main charcter) is
presenting the script to his book to his publisher, Faukman. The
manuscript says, in essance, that the Holy Grail is something much more
than a simple cup.

From Chapter 38:

> Langdon grinned again. 'The Holy Grail is arguable the most
> sought-after treasure in human history....Now you know why.'
>
> Faukman was still shaking his head. 'But with all these books written
> about it, why isn't this theory more widely known?'
>
> 'These books can't possibly compete with centuries of established
> history, especially when that history is endorsed by the ultimate
> bestseller of all time.'
>
> Faukman's eyes went wide. 'Don't tell me *Harry Potter* is about the
> Holy Grail.'
>
> 'I was referring to the Bible.'
>
> Faukan cringed. 'I knew that.'
