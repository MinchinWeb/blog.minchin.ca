*Saturday, May 2, 2009*

Today's goal was Mesa, Arizona, with a start from San Diego.

I decided to take the I-10 instead of the I-8, which runs almost along
the Mexican border, as that way I get a better entrance to Phoenix. From
where I was, I went north to San Bernardino, and then turned east. Maybe
half an hour past that the city dries up and you've hit desert. I'm glad
I'm doing this trip in early May and not the height of the summer; as it
is the temperature today hit 32C (over 90F). Before you get to Palm
Springs, wind turbines show up on both sides of the road, almost like
they're fields growing them. I stopped at Desert Hot Springs for gas
(which was right by the turbines) and the wind was just howling. If we
get a wind like that back home, it's with the rain (and probably hail)
is coming in sideways! The guy at the gas station said it's like that
all the time. From Palm Springs on, it starts feeling really lonely,
with signs warning you there are no services for 60 miles. I stopped to
find a bathroom in a place called Desert Center -- no one would care
about a dot this small (population 125) except for the fact there's
nothing for 40 miles to the east and 60 miles to the west! The
vegetation is different too. While San Diego is relatively green, in
Mesa, many 'lawns' are actually rock gardens.

For tomorrow, the plan is to go to church here in Mesa, and then drive
to El Paso, although I might drive further as I hope to make it to
Dallas the next night, and there's about 1000km between the two....
