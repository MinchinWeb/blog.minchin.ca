Homepage redesign is kind of a big deal; people get used to seeing a
site look a certain way and a site design can completely change that
look. I am in the middle of doing that. On one hand, I’ll be sad to see
my header image from Hawai’i go, but like the simplicity of what is
replacing it. All told, the design is something that I’ve been working
on in spits and spurts for almost two years. Hover over the images in
the middle of the page and it will tell you what they link to. [Check it
out!](http://minchin.ca/design/www.minchin.ca/kwick.htm) (For those of
you who want to see what the [old
version](http://minchin.ca/design/www.minchin.ca/about.htm) looked
like...)

We’ll see what my time in the coming days is like, but I hope to launch
a redesign of my blog in the coming days as well.
