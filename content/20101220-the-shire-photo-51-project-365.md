Not the Shire from The Hobbit, but the countryside just a few miles from
where we live. The French countryside is simply amazing, and quite the
constrast to [the
flatness](http://www.flickr.com/photos/minchinweb/2658117266/) closer to
where I grew up. The other amazing thing for me was the fact that
everything is still this green into late October. (That has changed only
here in late December as everything is now covered in snow.)
