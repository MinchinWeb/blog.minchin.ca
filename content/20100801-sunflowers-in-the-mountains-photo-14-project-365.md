Since I'm making up the rules, it can't be cheating and I'm going to put
up another photo. Perhaps it even works better when placed beside [the
mountains from earlier
today]({filename}20100801-the-epic-mountains-photo-13-project-365.md).
I love the colour in the flowers, especially against the quieter
background. The flowers, with their bent and twisted petals, give a
realism to the scene. How wonderful it is to be close to nature. :)
