Version 9 of *MetaLibrary* has been released.

To recap, *MetaLibrary* is a collection of code I've written to simplify
writing an AI for [OpenTTD](http://www.openttd.org/), a remake of my
childhood favorite, Transport Tycoon.

Version 9 brings a couple of bug fixes in the Python build script. The
[documentation for MetaLibrary](http://minchin.ca/openttd-metalibrary/)
has also been updated.
