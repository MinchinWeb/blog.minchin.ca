Living right off the ocean is fascinating for me, in part probably
because I grew up over 1000km from the sea! Add to that that the ocean
is rarely still, continuously moving rocks and sand and sometimes people
too. This picture was taken as the tide went out, causing water to drain
off the beach. What I love about this picture is its ability to show a
camera's ability to mask scale. How high do you think those cliffs are?
10 feet? 50? 200? In reality, they are about 4 inches tall!
