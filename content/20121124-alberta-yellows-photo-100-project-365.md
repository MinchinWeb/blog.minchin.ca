Alberta is amazing for its landscapes. Much of it is flat, and combined with
roads surveyed before anyone lived there on even mile spacing, you can get
roads that seem to go on forever. This picture was take in October
(Thanksgiving weekend, actually) and so the grass was basically dead but the
snow had yet to come, leaving this beautiful palette of yellows.
