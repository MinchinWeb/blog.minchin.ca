As life goes by, it seems more and more important to know what time it
is. Your bus comes at this time, your flight leaves at this time and
your meeting across town is at this time. In theory, the better you know
the time, the better you are at being on time, right? I wish!

Besides the practical aspects of knowing the time, I always thought it
was cool to see the row of clocks behind the reception desk of big
companies in the movies. Now I found a way to add that to my blog!
[World Time Server.com](http://www.worldtimeserver.com/) allows you to
create a snipit of code and then insert it on your site that displays an
analog clock in the colour scheme, size, and time zone of your choosing.
I think it's cool. Here's my little gallery of world times:

**Update** (2023-07-12): The original embedable clocks were written in Flash,
but Flash log ago disappeared from the web. However, World Time Server released
a replacement HTML5 version, which is now embedded below!
