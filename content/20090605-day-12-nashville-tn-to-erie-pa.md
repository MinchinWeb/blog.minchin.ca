*Thursday, May 7, 2009*

Today is pretty unexciting as far as the plan goes -- drive north and
east, and put me within a short day's drive of Montreal. I wonder if I
can make Erie, which my GPS tells me is 10½ hours away...

I started by heading north out of Nashville, and so thus across
Kentucky. There's signs for the huge cave complex, just off the road.
This is one of the funny things about this trip -- you read about stuff
like this in a magazine but you never think you'll make it there, and
now I'm driving by. As I look on the map, I realize Lincoln's birthplace
is about 10 miles off the road. The site is a neat way to learn a little
more about this American president, and an hour and a half later I'm on
the road. I decided to keep on the side road I was on -- it wasn't that
much slower than the Interstate, especially considering the 10 miles I'd
have to backtrack to go back to I-65, plus the side road (US-35E) was
much more beautiful. Lunch was a 'home made' sandwich from the deli at
the IGA in New Haven, and then on past Cincinnati, where I got back on
the Interstate. From Cincinnati, I got on the I-71, which has a very
handy northeast angle across the state of Ohio. Just south of Cleveland,
a little bit of fog rolled in, and with the full moon and the trees and
the night sky, it made for a beautiful scene (but one nearly impossible
to capture on film, unfortunately). As a side tour through Cleveland, I
stopped in and managed to find the complex in Beechwood where I lived
several years ago. From there, it was east along the I-90. I got to Erie
PA about one in the morning, but while the rest of the world may be on
Eastern Time, my head is still somewhere between Mountain and Central,
so it didn't seem near that late and I felt like I could keep going for
a while, I figured I'd better stop for the night as the next stretch of
road was pretty bare, with no obvious place to stop. Tomorrow:
Montreal!!

born. Near Hodgenville, Kentucky.
