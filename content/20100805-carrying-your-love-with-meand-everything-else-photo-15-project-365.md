I don't buy much 'stuff' and so I can get pretty excited about the stuff
I do buy (school has a way of eating up all your money...). I've been
toying with it for over a year and so I finally went out and bought a
portable hard drive. Now I'll be able to carry all of my photos with me
on the go. The literature that comes with it says it has room for
150,000 JPEG's...
