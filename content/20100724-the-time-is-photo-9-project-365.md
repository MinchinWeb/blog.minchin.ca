I wanted to try something a little out there, so I took this one of my
clock radio through my glasses. Shooting without my glasses is a little
suspenseful, because I can't see what the picture really looks like (no
preview) till it shows up on the camera screen! But I like this one. So
that's what I'm putting up today. :)
