In case you took a weekend away from the computer, which I apparently didn't,
Google has just bought out
[Feedburner](http://minchinweb.blogspot.com/2007/04/feedburner-fun.html). I'm
not sure what this will mean for me, although they have promised to keep the
service up and running. I imagine there will be some re-branding, and I'm
hoping for better integration with my other Google services, like Blogger,
Analytics, and AdSense. I'll keep my eyes open, and let you know if something
really crazy happens.
