### The List

One of the classic time management tools is a list of things that need
your attention; a “To Do” list. In its simplest form, it is a list.
However, when keeping such a general list, I often find myself
overwhelmed by the number of items and the fact that the more I used the
list the longer it would grow. I found that if I separated those items
that needed my attention now from those that I wanted to keep on my list
for reference, my “To Do” list was still useful, and I didn’t find
myself overwhelmed. I break my list into three sections: **To Do**,
**Should Do**, and **Could Do**.

#### To Do

These are the most important and urgent items on the list; the things
that have pressing deadlines and need urgent attention. I keep this
section short by limiting it to one item per project or role I have.

#### Should Do

These are the things that are a little less urgent, but things that
really should be taken care of soon. Next time I address my list, these
items are prime candidates to be moved up to the “To Do” section.

#### Could Do

These are the items that are neither extremely important nor pressing,
but that I would like to accomplish. This section of the list is mostly
for reference, so I can worry about remembering other things. This
section typically ends up being the longest.

### My Current List

Although I list items below in a general sense, my actual list has very
specific items. Especially on the ‘To Do’ list, I try to keep items to
what I could accomplish in a single sitting; if it would take more time
than that, it ends up on a list as multiple entries. For my list to be
most helpful, I need to keep in current, meaning updated at least
weekly, and handy, meaning it’s often a piece of paper I carry with me
everywhere. Below is a selection of items from the list I put together
about a week ago; I’ll need to sit down in the next day or so to rewrite
it.

#### To Do

-   An assignment due next week
-   Appointments I need to set for the coming week
-   Tickets for a conference I want to attend in a month that sells out
    quickly

#### Should Do

-   This blog post
-   Car wash and oil change
-   Clean up my desk
-   Accommodations for the above conference
-   Update my journal

#### Could Do

-   Various blog post ideas
-   Review material for an upcoming course
-   Write several friends I haven’t talked to in months
-   Post some pictures from my latest holiday to Facebook
-   Update various computer programs
-   Various ‘under-the-hood’ improvements to my website: add a
    robots.txt file, add meta tag descriptions, etc

### A Final Note

Efforts like keeping a “To Do” list should serve to simplify your life;
if they are not, you need to either revise the method or ditch it. With
that in mind, my “To Do” list has taken many forms and this is simply
the latest evolution. I imagine my list will be further refined, and
there will be times when I ditch it completely, but I hope someone finds
this useful. *Bonne chance!*
