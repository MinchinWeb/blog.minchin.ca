Just after Christmas, I went exploring in northern France. One of my
many stops was the iconic cathedral in Chartres, a little out of Paris.
Candles are lit by many of the patrons and pilgrims, as a sort of
prayer, as I understand it. But the light of the candles in the dark
cathedral made for a beautiful picture.
