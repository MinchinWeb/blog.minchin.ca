My continuing adventures took me to London and to see the Queen!
Actually, the Queen was nowhere to be seen, but I did see Buckingham
Palace and the Changing of the Guards. On the square surrounding
Buckingham Palace are gates recognizing the different British colonies
and on the gates of the Palace itself sit the Arms of Britain itself. I
thought the gold leaf was cool and it provided a nice contrast against
the grey-green iron of the rest of the gate.
