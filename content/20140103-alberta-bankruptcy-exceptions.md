Out of curiosity, I looked up the Alberta Bankruptcy Exceptions. In a nutshell,
this is what you can keep even if you declare bankruptcy:

> 
> 1.  Property you hold in trust for other people
> 2.  Food: 12 months' supply.
> 3.  Clothing: up to $4,000.
> 4.  Household furniture and appliances: up to $4,000
> 5.  One motor vehicle; up to $5,000
> 6.  Health aids: no dollar limit.
> 7.  Tools of your trade: up to $10,000.
> 8.  Farm property: requirements for 12 months operations (if debtor's primary
>     income is from farming operations)
> 9.  Principal residence: up to $40,000, reduced to your share if you are a
>     co-owner.
> 10. Farm land: up to 160 acres (if the debtor's principal residence is
>     located on that 160 acres and that the 160 acres is part of the debtor's
>     farm)
> 11. Social allowance, handicap benefit or a widow's pension if the proceeds
>     from the payment are not intermingled with your other funds.
> 12. Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), Registered Retirement Income
>     Funds (RRIFs), Registered Disability Savings Plans (RDSPs) and Deferred
>     Profit Sharing Plans (DPSPs). (except for contributions made in the year
>     preceding bankruptcy).
>
> Student loans are now dischargeable in a bankruptcy that occurs once a
> student has been out of school for seven years. A bankrupt loses their tax
> refund for the entire year of bankruptcy.

Some thoughts:

-   I suppose one case where you might get close to 'abusing' this is creating
    a contingency plan for ifÂ  your business debts that go south and you become
    personally liable. Proper legal structuring can help, but it's not uncommon
    for mortgages for revenue properties (rentals) to ask for a personal
    guarantee. That said, I imagine many of the people going through bankruptcy
    are happy to be able to keep anything at all.
-   It is good to know that property held in trust is exempt. So if you're
    saving money for the kids, get it out of your bank account and put it in
    trust to them (legally)!
-   Including food on this list is interesting, only because very few (any?)
    other jurisdictions include it. If you ever wanted a reason for keeping
    food storage around, here it is! I suppose part of this too is no one wants
    to try to sell your "used" food at garage sale prices.
-   It's also good to know that registered retirement savings are protected
    too. In Canada, it's pretty hard to access this money before you're
    actually retirement age without significant tax costs, but it's still a
    fairly significant protection. Note that TFSA's (which aren't retirement
    savings anyway) aren't protected.
-   I think the most interesting discussion is the house exemption. Some states
    have very high 'homestead' exceptions - Florida's, for example, is
    unlimited in value, although limited in acreage. The long and short of it
    is I don't think many people will keep their house with the $40,000
    exception. It is a reasonable question whether the exception should be big
    enough to allow people to keep their homes. Not having to move could
    provide significant emotional stability at a time of great uncertainty.
    However, for many people, their home likely represents their largest asset
    which might to sold to make their creditors whole (or at least closer to
    whole), and the mortgage against their home is probably their biggest
    liability. So I guess the note here is you and your home are probably going
    to be separated as part of the bankruptcy process.
-   Student loans are an interesting note. In the US, student loans are
    non-dischargeable in bankruptcy (meaning if you declare bankruptcy, you
    still have to pay your student loans). However, 7 years in a long time. In
    general, Canadian student loans are generally amortized over 10 years, with
    the option to extend that to 15 years. So by the time that you might be
    able to discharge your student loans, you've already paid 50-70+% of them
    off.
-   I never want to deal with bankruptcy!
