A wonderful citation

manager was introduced in Microsoft Word 2007 (found on the ‘Reference’
tab, see below).\

It allows one to add

sources to a paper or report as it is being typed in a nearly automated

fashion and will then compile your reference list too. For me, it’s been
a godsend; I like writing papers (well enough,

anyway) but get annoyed when ‘minor’ details, like what referencing
styles should

be used, start taking up major time. Great as it is, the one problem
that remained

was Word was limited to a few built-in styles; if the required style
wasn’t on

the list, you were just out of luck. Well, it turns out that the Word
system is

actually quite extendable. The open source project
[BibWord](http://bibword.codeplex.com/) has

provided a framework to quickly add new styles and has generated a
number of new

ones. Based on that work, I here present my version of the TRB reference

style based on their [Guide for
Authors](http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/AM/InfoForAuthors.pdf) (PDF).\
\

In-text references are numberic, based on reference order.

Repeated references reuse the original number.\
