I got a kick out of a flyer that came in the mail the other day. The
Alberta Cancer Foundation has launched its annual "<span id="r5vs">[Cash
and Cars](http://www.cashandcarslottery.ca/ "Cash and Cars")</span>"
lottery. The flyer starts with a display of the cars, some 26 in all,
starting with the SLR McLaren. Following is a page for the cash prizes
(valued between five and fifty thousand dollars), showing a pile of cash
and the tagline "Consider it cab fare". I guess everyone wins a "car",
even if it's a taxi (\$50,000 will give you quite the taxi ride!). It
cracked me up.
