Insects can be fun to photograph because you see something up close that
is usually too small to inspect. The problem I discovered was the depth
of field was so shallow (with half of the bug in focus and the other
not) that I found it nearly impossible to focus with the camera in hand.
But I thought it made a pretty cool photo anyway.
