*Sunday, May 3, 2009*

The plan was to do church in Mesa with the family I was staying with,
and then drive to El Paso, about 6 hours down the road.

The first thing that threw me off is **Arizona doesn't do daylight
savings time** and so it's on the same time zone as California, not as
Edmonton, as I had originally thought. That's a fun way to be confused,
never knowing quite what time it is. Because of that, whenever I've
asked someone when something is since, I've taken to asking them what
time they have right now so I make sure to show up at the right time!

Church was good, and ironically I ended up in the "Sherwood Park Ward" --
I attended the Sherwood Park 1st Ward for many years near Edmonton
growing up. After church, the plan was simply to drive east, although I
did want to catch the [CES fireside that night by Elder
Bednar](http://lds.org/broadcast/ces/0,7341,538,00.html). It seemed
there were three places along my route that were big enough to be
showing the fireside -- Tucson AZ, Las Cruces NM, and El Paso TX. After
my visit at the Mesa Temple on the way out of town, I realized there was
no way I could make Las Cruces (about 4 hours down the road from Tucson)
and so after a few phone calls, I managed to find out where the
Institute building was in Tucson and when the broadcast was, and so I
pulled in with about an hour to spare. The fireside was great -- in part
it was a warning of technology misused and some of the dangers can lurk
in digital models and worlds if we're not careful -- a very timely
warning in my opinion.

The Institute program in Tucson seems like it would be wonderful -- they
have five university wards, and a beautiful building on the U of A
(Arizona, not Alberta...) campus, and the people feel welcoming and
warm. In the little time I was there, I felt welcomed and I was even
invited to a movie later, but I had many miles yet to make that night.

The drive from Tucson to El Paso was uneventful, but a little long. The
combination of not too much topography and a night sky means there
really isn't a lot to see. In El Paso, the plan was to stay at the Youth
Hostel in the Grander Hotel right downtown.

Tomorrow, the goal is Dallas, where a friend of a friend has offered me
their couch for the night. To make Dallas though is going to call for a
full day of driving, and from the look on the map, there really isn't
much between the two....
