These are the sort of pictures one sees set among the islands of the
Pacific, and every time I see one, I want to be there! If pictures tell
stories, then I think the story here is this: The shoes represent the
responsibilities and rules of "normal life" left behind; Our heroine is
left to play out her care-free dreams in the sun and the sand. I think
it's a dream we all have from time to time. In some ways, that life is
what I have right now, although both sun and sand have been in rather
limited supply; instead I find clouds and gravel. But the ocean is still
there!

Tell me the story this picture coveys to you...
