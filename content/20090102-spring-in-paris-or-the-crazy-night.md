A couple days ago we made a run to IKEA to get a little furniture to
spruce up our place, and I came home with a painting to put on the wall
(an unplanned purchase, but I like Paris, so why not?). The picture is
called *Printemps à Paris* (Spring in Paris) and was taken by a lady
from Alberta. I decided to make a video of us putting it up and it
turned out hilarious!

The video was done in time lapse style, taking one frame every 5 seconds
with a 1 second exposure, and then playing back at 1/8 sec per frame. I
took almost 1900 frames, so this 4 minutes of video covers 3 hours of
real time!
