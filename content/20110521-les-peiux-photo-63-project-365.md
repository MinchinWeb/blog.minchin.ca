This is also from St. Malo. St. Malo is a coastal city and can have so
very large tides. To protect the city, there is a seawall, and to help
protect the seawall and dissipate the energy of the breaking waves,
there is a double line of woods stakes (*peiu*) that I thought made a
very neat picture from above.
