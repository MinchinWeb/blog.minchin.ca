I feel like I spend too much time on the internet, but every so often I
do come across something interesting. Whether it's interesting for you
is something you'll have to decide. I'll probably post such web sites as
I would want to some day come back to, or tell someone else to check
out.

Today as I surfed around to learn a little more about blogs, I came
across this history of Blogs by Rebecca Blood
([here](http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html)). I
thought it well written and easy to read. In a nut shell, she says that
originally (circa 1998), weblogs were basically a collection of links
that provided you with the web in a sort of "pre-surfed" fashion. About
the time Blogger.com came out, blogs exploded onto the web and many
moved to being personal journals of sorts. That's what happens when you
don't have to know any HTML to put up a blog. Now there's so many blogs,
it as confusing to find something useful out of them as the internet as
a whole.

As for me, it is just a fun hobby and a way to express a few thoughts,
so I guess I fall into the second class.
