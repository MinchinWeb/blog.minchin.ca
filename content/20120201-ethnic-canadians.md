I recently stumbled across this map of "Leading Ethnicity by Census
Division," based on the 2006 Canadian census ([original
on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Censusdivisions-ethnic.png)).
Maps fascinate me and I thought this one was pretty cool. I thought I'd
share a few thoughts, but first the map itself:

Some of my observations:

-   there are a lot of immigrants in Toronto - the suburbs there contain
    the one East Indian and the one Italian mention on the map.
-   the Inuit are the most common in Nunavut, which I guess is to be
    expected, but I guess I assumed they'd be better represented in
    northern Northwest Territories or in the Yukon.
-   I'm surprised that the Yukon comes up as "English" rather than
    "First Nations" (North American Indian) or "Inuit."
-   I know the Ukrainians from north-central Alberta (perogies...yum!),
    but they don't show up there, but rather a strip across eastern
    Saskatchewan into Manitoba. I hadn't realized that the Ukrainians
    had settled over that big an area, but why not?
-   Of the two place French showed up, one made sense and the other
    surprised me. Cape Breton made sense, as that was a French
    stronghold for many years (centuries). Northern Alberta surprised
    me - I knew there was some French-speaking presence there, but I
    didn't think it would be the largest ethnic group. I'm also
    surprised "French" didn't surface in Quebec.
-   Quebeckers, most predominately, identify themselves as "Canadian." I
    think that bodes well for national unity.
-   "Canadian" shows up for the eastern part of Ontario, New Brunswick,
    Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland - places that have been historically
    under alternatively English and French control. Areas that have
    never been under French control, like Alberta and British Columbia,
    show up as "English."
-   I'm surprised that Newfoundland would come up as "Canadian." There
    aren't a lot of people moving to the island, and only those born
    there in the last 60 years were even born under a Canadian flag!
    (Newfoundland was a separate British colony until it join Canadian
    Confederation in 1949.)
-   I wonder if the many ethnicities showing up on the prairies
    (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta) compared with the prominence
    of "Canadian" further east simply a result of history, or a lack
    thereof: basically people on the prairies still remember where their
    grandfathers came from and there hasn't been as much mixing of
    communities as have happen further east to complicate the question
    of ethnicity.

Another interesting realization for me was the difference between
"ethnicity" and "race," which I guess I had considered equivalent
beforehand. [Wikipedia defines
ethnicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group) as "is a group of
people whose members identify with each other, through a common
heritage, often consisting of a common language, a common culture (often
including a shared religion) and/or an ideology that stresses common
ancestry or endogamy." It further explains "The concept of ethnicity
differs from the closely related term race in that 'race' refers to
grouping based mostly upon biological criteria, while 'ethnicity' also
encompasses additional cultural factors."

In all, the ethnicity of "Canadian" is a construct, and likely still in
the process of being defined. I guess it plays into the fundamental
question of what it means to "be Canadian": is that a
self-identification questions? a combination of geography and history?
solely citizenship?
