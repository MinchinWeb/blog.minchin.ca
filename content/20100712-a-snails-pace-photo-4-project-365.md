On my way home from some morning errands, I spotted a snail working its
way along the concert lawn edger. In the few minutes I took to get my
camera from inside, he was gone (I have no idea where he could have got
to...), but I did find his buddy working across the grass. Now this
guy's famous!

This is similar to the technique I used yesterday, where you stop down
the f-stop number to limit what's in focus. At ƒ/1.8 it gets rather
tricky as, if you set it wrong, you'll have the grass in front in focus
and not the snail...
