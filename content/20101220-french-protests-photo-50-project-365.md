The strikes here in France seemed to be nearly constant. We spent our
first month in France wondering whether we would have public buses the
next day and double checking modified inter-city train schedules. When
we asked our French friends about it, they would shrug and reply
"Welcome to France!" with a wry smile. The retirement reforms (moving
the minimum retirement age up to 62) have since passed and with Noël
(Christmas) upcoming, things seem to have quieted down considerably.
