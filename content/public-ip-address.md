Ever wonder what your public IP Address is? Well, check it out at

So, what is an IP address? It’s a little like a phone number or an
email, but for your computer. When you send a request onto the Internet,
your IP address serves as the “return address”. It can be useful to know
your IP address for various on-line applications, like on-line gaming.

It should be noted that this is your public IP address, which can be
different from you computer’s IP address if you are behind a proxy or a
firewall. People with high-speed internet access often have a fixed IP
address, which is sometimes a concern, and often, hence the firewall.
Those using dail-up internet typically have a new IP address assigned to
them each time they log in.
