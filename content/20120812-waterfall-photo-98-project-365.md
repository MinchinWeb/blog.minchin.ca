Still in the National Parks between Banff and Jasper, I found this waterfall.
The effect I was going for here was one of fluid motion - by setting a
(relatively) long shutter speed (a tenth of a second, in this case), the motion
of the water is captured. At the other extreme, with an extremely fast shutter
speed, you can freeze a waterfall, making it look almost as if it had turned to
ice in an instant.

### Project Update

So this is the end of my first batch of 'Project 365' photos - 98 photos that
have taken over two years to be put up. I realize that is a far cry from the
original plan of a photo a day for a year. I can blame part of the backlog on
moving five times and the following periods without internet, but regardless, I
am through that backlog. Now I can post pictures closer to when I take them and
hopefully offer more meaningful commentary. In short, I look forward to posting
more pictures here soon!
