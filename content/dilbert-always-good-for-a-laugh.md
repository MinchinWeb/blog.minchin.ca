Every so often I need a good laugh…and "Dilbert" by Scott Adams so often
fits the bill. For those of you out of the loop, Dilbert is the engineer
with the upturned tie who has a rather depressing social life and an
imbecile of a boss. The humour, I suppose, comes from the fact the
situations Dilbert has to deal with are far too common in cubicle-land.
The [official site](http://www.dilbert.com/) carries the last month of
cartoons ("Dilbert" is published daily), but that’s not very useful to
pull up my all-time favorites. Yesterday I found the solution! This guy,
[S Anand](http://www.s-anand.net), has put together a collection of
Dilbert comics stretching back over six years! Check it out -\> [Dilbert

A couple of my favorites too:

-   [Dilbert and his (broken)
    Xbox](http://www.s-anand.net/dilbert.html#20061031) - Oct. 31, 2006
-   [Career Day](http://www.s-anand.net/dilbert.html#20071118) - Nov.
