We didn't get much snow, living on the coast as we were in Dieppe, but a
little showed up just before Christmas. This photo was taken a little
before dawn, which lends itself to the gentle light. On this particular
morning, I was hoping to get into the school where I worked because I
thought I could get a nice time lapse of the sun coming up across the
harbour. Although the school is normally open Saturday mornings, on this
particular morning I found the doors locked. Maybe it was the snow,
maybe it was because it was the day before Christmas vacation...
