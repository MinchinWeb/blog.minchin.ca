<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

Every so often I need a good laugh...and "Dilbert" by Scott Adams so often
fits the bill. For those of you out of the loop, Dilbert is the engineer
with the upturned tie who has a rather depressing social life and an
imbecile of a boss. The humour, I suppose, comes from the fact the
situations Dilbert has to deal with are far too common in cubicle-land.

<del>The [official site](http://www.dilbert.com/) carries the last month of
cartoons ("Dilbert" is published daily), but that's not very useful to
pull up my all-time favourites. Yesterday I found the solution! This guy,
[S Anand](http://www.s-anand.net), has put together a collection of
Dilbert comics stretching back over six years! Check it out --> [Dilbert

**Update (June 2018):** The official site seems now to carry the full archive
(or at least these two I want to point to) and the un-official archive I was
pointing to no longer works. So time to update the links.

A couple of my favourites too:

-   [Dilbert and his (broken)
    Xbox](hhttp://dilbert.com/strip/2006-10-31) - Oct. 31, 2006
-   [Career Day](http://dilbert.com/strip/2007-11-18) - Nov.
    18, 2007

What is your favourite Dilbert cartoon?
