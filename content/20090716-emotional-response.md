'Geers (or 'engineers,' to the uninitiated) have a thing for numbers,
and thus like to make full use of them to solve any problem that comes
their way. For example, to size a pipe, you take the flow rate (a
number), work a little bit of calculus (or black magicâ€¦), and you get
out the pipe diameter (another number). 'Geers like their numbers enough
they've even figured out how to assign numbers to things that usually
don't get numbers, like public support, personal preferences, safety
ratings, the simplicity of the solution, etc.

There are good reasons to use numbers -- others can follow your logic,
and you can back up any conclusion you reach. But that can fall apart
when you meet the 'real world' -- a world beyond the laboratory doors
that works on relationships and feelings, and not so much on hard
numbers. Most of us manage to fumble through our outings in this world
well enough, but eventually, you'll meet that girl-of-your-dreams. Then
comes that fateful day where she's going to look into your eyes and say
"Hunny, why do you love me so?" It's not celestial mechanics (otherwise
known as 'rocket science for planets'), but if you can nail that one,
it'll move heaven and earth! I'll give you a hint -- she's probably not
looking for a number here, even if she has a better number than any
other girl you've ever met. In fact, if you tell her she's a 9.5, or
start listing off things like "public support, personal preferences,
etc.", she'll probably slap you. No, instead she is looking for an
**emotional response**. But how does a guy, trained in rational thought,
give an emotion-based answer?

I don't have an answer, but having the question I count as a start. I
guess until then, I can always consider what a fellow 'geer suggests:

> [Surviving the World -- Lesson #55 -- Scientific
> Love](http://survivingtheworld.net/Lesson55.html), or "How to Find
> Love While Being a Male Engineer"

I wonder how much flights are to Albania...
