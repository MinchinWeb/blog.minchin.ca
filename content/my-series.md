I recently switched to the new version of Blogger. From your end, I'm
sure it looks very much the same. On my end, that is for the most part
true as well, but there are a few subtle changes. Most that I have come
across are in the post editing options. I can edit the posting date, and
individually set whether to allow your comments and backlinks, and to
edit the post time. Another option that I quite like is the ability to
add labels. Because it's so new I don't think I've really got the hang
of it, but for now, I'll explain the series I've started:

On-Line Wonders
:   As I've started to create my blog, I've found lots of sites the
    offer some service, useful to webmasters and bloggers in one manner
    or another. They are listed here, and where possible, I demonstrate
    their service in or below the post.

Quote
:   Not really a series in the proper sense, but I'll flag the quote
    that I add to various posts so that you can scroll through them
    easily (that's what labels are supposed to do, right?)

Reading
:   I love to read, and so often come across an interesting tidbit, and
    so offer it here.

Web Site-seeing
:   My blog carries a tag-line referring to the hidden gems on the web.
    This is a selection of them. Granted, it is by no means exhaustive,
    but I try to pick the fun and sometime random things that I come
    across. Differing from **On-Line Wonders**, these tend to me web
    sites that you will have to go and see yourself to really
    appreciate.
