Spending 7 months as part of the Rouen Branch meant that, in a way, they
become our family, and the Caen District, which covered all of Normandy,
became our extended family. Our last week in "France" was actually spent
with the District at the Temple in Frankfurt. We knew that
District Conference was this last weekend, and we were a little
disappointed to come home just before it, but I was very surprised to
receive this email:\

So, the Caen District has ceased to exist! The Branches of Rouen, Le
Havre, and Caen have been moved to the Paris Stake (based out of
Versailles), and the Alençon Branch has been moved to the Angers Stake.
What I don't know is what happened to the Branches of Coutances or
Cherbourg. Possibilities include them also be part of the Paris Stake,
the Angers Stake or the Lorient Distrist (informally, the "Brittany
District"), or possibly they are directly under the Mission! (The
Evereax Branch was closed down a year or two ago and merged with the
Mantes-la-Jolie Ward in the suburbs of Paris).\

\

On one hand, I'm sad to see the District go, but I know there has been a
lot of talk over the years on how the Caen District could become the
Caen Stake but the numbers just we're there. I think this will be a good
way to reach the same result of offering the members in Normandy the
strength of being in a Stake.\

I'm always excited to watch the Church progress in France!\

\

<u>Stakes, Districts, Wards and Branches:</u> I should explain, for
those not familiar, what a "Stake," etc is. In the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints (the "Mormon Church"), the members are
organized geographically. The local units are Wards. About a dozen Wards
are grouped together into a Stake. Branches and Districts are similar to
Wards and Stakes, but used when there are less members. Wards are about
have 150 to 300 members, and can vary is size. In some parts of the
United States, a Ward will correspond to a neighbourhood, but in France
a Branch or two would often cover a *Department*.
