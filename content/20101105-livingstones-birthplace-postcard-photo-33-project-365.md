Still with the Family History theme, I also came across this postcard
sent to my 2nd Great-Grandfather by his sister. It speaks to a different
era, when people had more connections to the home country and so would
go for months to visit the country and family. The note on the back
("This is a real photograph") speaks to the state of the art of
photography -- still complicated and expensive. The other thing that
amazes me is how simple the address is. All in all, it's an interesting
peak into the past.
