The often supplied answer, in some circles, to any question that seems
to do with economics is "let the market decide!" However, the limits of
what the market can do effectively are rarely discussed. What the market
allows is for rational actors to compete for limited resources. Where
that falls apart is where one of those assumptions fails: the actors
cease to be rational, the actors can't compete, or the resource (or
demand) is not longer limited. And often times, when someone faces an
out-of-pocket hospital bill, all three assumptions fail. When someone is
severely hurt, it is hard to argue that they are in a frame of mind to
make rational decisions; people in the hospital are rarely in a state of
mind to 'comparison shop' hospitals; and many people value their health
to such a point that effectively their 'demand' is unlimited (think what
life insurance policies pay out...). In short, it seems to me that
leaving the market alone to set the price of our health care services is
not a bright idea. I value my health and agree that healthcare
professionals should be paid well for their services, but I am much more
appreciative of healthcare I can actually afford!
