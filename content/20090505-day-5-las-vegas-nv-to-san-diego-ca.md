*Thursday, April 30, 2009*

I woke up this morning in Vegas, and the goal is San Diego, with a stop
at the Hoover Dam since I didn't make it yesterday.

Hoover Dam is only about 30 miles out of Vegas, so it's a short little
drive. When I got there, the elevators were down and so they weren't
giving tours inside the dam, so I just walked around on top for a bit.
FYI -- if it's not too busy, there's free parking on the Arizona side
that is relatively close, with more free parking as you go up the hill.
They're in the process of upgrading Highway US-89 (the 2 lane highway
that goes across the dam) to 4 lanes and so they're putting an arch
bridge just downstream which should help traffic and provide some great
views. From the Hoover Dam, I headed for San Diego. The freaky part was
how the freeway changed as soon as I hit the California line -- the
traffic seemed to get heavier, and it never really seemed to turn back
into the rural freeway that I'd driven much of the time up till then.
California is beautiful, but lots of hills (and traffic). Tomorrow, I'm
just going to stick around San Diego.
