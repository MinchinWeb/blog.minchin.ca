**The Minchin Timesheet System** is designed to provide an easy way to
keep track of time spent on various projects, especially in situations
where the user is working on several projects serially. From the main
interface, click on "Record Time Stamp" will prompt the user for a
project number, a subproject number, and their employee number. When
they are finished, they click "Record Time Stamp" a second time to log
off. A button ("Am I Logged In or Out?") provides a simple way of
confirming their status. A third button ("Generate Timesheet") will
automatically generate a timesheet for the employee, breaking down their
time by day, project and subproject, and saving the result as an easy to
email or print PDF.

This is an update to the original version (v1.0), released at
[University Student VBA
Projects](http://vbaprojects.blogspot.com/2010/04/minchin-timesheet-v1025059.html).
This update smooths over the edges a little, corrects a few minor math
mistakes, and adds an "About" dialogue.

Excel 2007 or newer is required.
