*Wednesday, May 6, 2009*

I woke up this morning a little later than I would have liked, but sure
it's the byproduct of a late night. The only real downside of it all was
I found out that breakfast was included in my hotel stay, but only till
9am! Oops, I guess I missed that one...

I hit the road, stopped at the Arkansas Welcome center where they
suggested a fun little place in Hope called Sheba's Family Restaurant,
which turned out to be great breakfast. Even though it was more or less
dark when I left Dallas the night before, I could tell much of US-82 had
been lined with trees (quite the contrast to western Texas...), and in
the morning light, Arkansas is green. The Interstate, almost all the way
through the state, is lined trees that are probably 60 feet tall.

I pulled into Memphis, just across the river from Arkansas, just in time
for dinner. Parking downtown was fun, like it always is, but I managed
to find a stop on the street and wondered down to Beale Street for
dinner. I ended up eating dinner (ribs, one of the best meals I've had
in a long time...), listening to live music. After a meal like that, I
wished I had more time to stick around and explore. I finished up the
night with a drive to Nashville, about 3 hours down the road, and stayed
at the Day's Inn - more expensive, but a way nicer place than the last
motel....

hard to get good pictures of stuff BESIDE the road as you go flying by,
but I saw huge churches like this all over the Arkansas and Tennessee.
