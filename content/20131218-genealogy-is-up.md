Many years ago when I first bought [minchin.ca](http://minchin.ca/), I thought
it would be neat to put my genealogy online. This stemmed, in part, from the
fact that most of the genealogy research I was doing was online. But it's taken
a long time to figure out how to generate the webpages a way I wanted. I wanted
a website that I could update without the links changing, and a way to hide the
information about living people. Just this last week I found *Adam*, an online
service hosted by Tim Forsythe, that will do that for me. So now my genealogy
is up! Check it out at
<del markdown=1>[minchin.ca/genealogy/](http://www.minchin.ca/genealogy/)</del>
[genealogy.minchin.ca](https://genealogy.minchin.ca/).

My genealogy remains a work in progress. If there are mistakes, let me know so
I can fix them. If we're related and long lost cousins, I'd love to hear from
you!

## Update (July 26, 2016)

*Adam* is no longer online, but Tim has continued to improve it and has bundled
most (all?) of it's functionality into
*[Gigatrees](http://timforsythe.com/gigatrees/)*, a downloadable executable for
Windows. I am continuing to use it to generate my genealogy website.
