I have a couple of exams tomorrow, but I find myself drawn here instead.
I guess I already knew I spent too much time on the Internet. I really
haven't been on that long today, but I've still found some interesting
things, including:

-   Airlines taking the polar route to Asia
-   Addictions drain the Canadian economy of \$40B/year
-   JoneSoft's File Splitter
-   a potential "miracle pill" that started with figuring out how pot
    works

I guess I want to put up polished things, so I won't have time to look
at these until probably Friday or next week.

</p>
I would like to think that someone is coming across this, so if you
stumble across this, just leave a little note (a comment, click on the
link below this post) saying you stopped in.

Anyways, I'll keep typing, even if I'm just talking to myself.
