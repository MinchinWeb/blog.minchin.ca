Several months ago I was in France and realized I would need to get a
job upon my return to North America. In today's interconnected world, I
thought doing my job search through the Internet would be the way to do
it. It turned out to be both brilliant and brutal, all at the same
time.

### The Brilliant

The Internet has made distances, for many purposes, very small indeed.
From France, I could search though hundreds of possible jobs from scores
of companies across North America. That sure beat flipping through the
classifieds, one local paper at a time. Search engines and job boards
made it easy to find even more possible jobs. When I found a position I
was interested in, email allowed me to submit my resume without having
to find a FAX machine or worry about the eight hour time difference.

### The Brutal

While the Internet has reworked the world in wonderful ways, not all the
implications have been dealt with.

Let me return to the metephor I mentioned in the title. Imagine an
Internet dating site. You've been told this is THE site, the one where
everyone hangs out on (and no, it's not Facebook...). It's free to sign
up so you start looking around. You find a couple of cute girls and
decide to try and get a date and that's when it all starts going
downhill. Each girl wants your vital stats, your relationship history,
and a few other random pieces of information you don't normally tell
complete strangers. More annoying is the fact that there's no
standardized way to enter the information; every other girl sends you to
her own website to enter it and no two of them look the same. After
spending every night for two weeks doing this, you're made it through
about ten 'applications' so you sit back and wait for someone to get
back to you.

Then you look up the numbers, just out of curiosity. In a nutshell,
they're dismal:

-   About 1 in 10 will write back and tell you they're dating someone
    else;
-   About 1 in 20 will get back to you and ask for more information;
-   Only about 1 in 100 will offer you a first date and of those only
    about 1 in 5 (so 1 in 500 of you original 'applications') will call
    you up for a second date.

If I would have known my odds were 0.2% going in, I probably would have
taken a cardboard sign down go the local street corner! At the very
least, I'd have a better story than spending weeks and months in front
of the computer...

### My Job Search

In the beginning, my job search was realitively simple, spending time on
the Internet with a goal of 2 or 3 applications a week. I spent about
three months at this until my internet connection suddenly died (French
customer service can be the subject of another post...grrr).

On returning to Canada, I rewrote my resume (twice) and then hit the
pavement. My 40 online applications netted me nothing, but of my 8
walk-ins, one landed me an interview and then a job.

### My Suggestions -- To Those Offering Jobs

My experience is just my own, but there are some lessons I hope I can
pass along.

-   Online job hunting is a great idea but it needs to be implemented
    well. Keep in mind that most job hunters will have to deal with
    several of these sites. Too many sites were cluncky, slow, and hard
    to navigate. The longer it takes for me to apply, the more likely I
    am to abandon part way through or to never come back. And although
    there might be a lot less effort to apply to the second job, I have
    to finish the first application.
-   Keep your website up to date. Do you know, for a fact, that your
    phone number and address are on your website and are current? Also,
    if you hire someone, take down the job posting; it's very
    frustrasting to prepare an application, call to get the submission
    email and at that point find out the position was filled last week.
-   Have good job descriptions. Too many job descriptions are filled
    with advertising copy for the company and too little about the
    actual position. If I'm applying for this job, you've already sold
    me on your company. Tell me about the specifics of the job and what
    I need to be able to do it. And if I have to call to get those
    details, let me talk to someone who actaully knows the details of
    the job. Please.
-   You only get one chance to make a first impression - how does your
    receptionist greet job seekers? With a smile and then have someone
    from HR come out to meet with them for two minutes? Or do they turn
    up their nose at a paper resume and tell the job seeker "We're a
    Green company [whatever that means...] and only accept online
    resumes"? I got both; the first type I followed up with while the
    second I crossed off my list (Where do you think I got their office
    address from?Â I had already visited their website and their tortured
    job section...).
-   And most importantly, keep it personal! If the Internet has
    destroyed realationships, it's the relationships between businesses
    and individuals. Too often in my job search I felt like I was being
    ignored by a computer. Much of my second phase of job hunting was
    about trying to figure out how I could talk to a living breathing
    human being! After a while, even the emails saying someone else had
    been selected started to be appreciated...

The wonders of the Internet have changed the way many things are done in
business, but when it comes to filling positions, let's not forget that
it's real people applying.
