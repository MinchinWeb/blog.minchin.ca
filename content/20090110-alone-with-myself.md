Slug: alone-with-myself

By nature, I am the type to keep a little to myself; I enjoy time out
with friends and in public, but I too need moments from time to time to
myself to re-energize and recollect. Over the years, I have grown to
appreciate quiet moments with my thoughts, to contemplate the world
around me and to better understand the world within.

The last few days have been different, for the time I have had alone has
been spent not with thoughts, but my feelings. My thoughts and ideas
will bend to reason but emotions offer no such simple explanation of
prerogative and intent. While my thoughts have become such that I can
pause and resume them with effort to allow me to concentrate on other
concerns, my emotions seem to roll over me like the spring
thundershowers - you feel the change in the winds and can anticipate the
coming rain, but the timing is never certain and the wonders of the
lightening show never ceases to amaze, and the best you can do is find
someplace dry to wait it out.

Emotions and thoughts are two different parts of me -- one that bends to
reason and the other that does not. Perhaps, in time, I will better
master my emotions, but for now, I watch the storm in its glory, and
eagerly await the cool morning that follows with the clearness and
renewal that always accompanies it.
