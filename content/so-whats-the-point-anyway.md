I sit down at my computer with an idea that’s been running around in my
head for a week or two and start typing. An hour later, I examine my
handiwork – it’s beautiful! But as I look closer, I start asking myself
“So what’s the point, anyway? Why would anyone else care?” What good is
a piece if it is nothing more than me rambling? I want people to be able
to take *something* away from my ramblings.... The next question is,
What do I do? Do I scrape this piece? Or do I rewrite it? Neither option
presents an easy solution. I’ve been down this road a couple times
now...

Garrrr! Why does good writing have to be so hard?!?
