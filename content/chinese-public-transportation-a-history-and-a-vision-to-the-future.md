#### Abstract

</p>
Public transit has existed in China since 1969 with the

opening of the Beijing Metro. Today, Shanghai has the largest metro
system in

the world, and is one of ten mainland Chinese cities, in addition to
Hong Kong,

that have a metro system. In addition, there are thirty more cities in
China

with metro systems either under construction or in planning stages.

</p>
The Hong Kong opened its metro system in 1979 in an effort

to reduce traffic congestion. Today, public transit on the whole is very

popular, with over 80% mode capture rate. Hong Kong continues to expand
its

rail transit network, but at a slower rate than many cities in mainland
China.

The system operator has also taken on the role of developer, generating
more

profits from property management than railway fares, and in the process
has

provided a very successful example of Transportation Oriented
Development (TOD)

policies in action, which are a model for TOD efforts worldwide.

</p>
In summary, a short compare and contrast between China’s

fast growing cities of today and post-World War II American cities is
provided.

Both are growing (or grew) at incredible speeds, have rising middle
classes and

significant economic growth. What Chinese planners can note is that in
America,

highways were chosen over public transportation options. Today, that
means that

traffic congestions remains a major problem in many American cities.

Additionally, funds to maintain infrastructure have waned as the cities’
growth

has slowed with the slowing of economic growth.

#### Introduction

</p>
Public transit is a relatively new phenomena in China. Planning for the

Beijing Metro began with the help of Soviet experts in 1950, but it
would be

almost twenty years until the system would open with one line in 1969.
In the

next twenty-five years, only Tianjin would open a metro system. However,

starting with Shanghai in 1995, a significant number of Chinese cities
have

opened metro systems and expanded their existing systems. Today,
Shanghai has

the largest system in the world; there are ten cities with systems in
operation

and 30 more with systems under construction or in planning. However,
there are

over 100 Chinese cities with a population greater than 1 million,
generally considered to be

the breakpoint where metro systems become feasible *([1](#IBI10))*.
While urban rail

transport is starting to gain traction in China, there is still much
possible

expansion.

</p>
Hong Kong, as a former British colony, has a much different history in

urban public rail. The first line opened in 1979 as an effort to reduce
traffic

congestion. From the beginning, the rail system has been very
successful, as

demonstrated by the fact that over 80% of Hongkongers use public
transportation

for their trips.

</p>
A brief history of select metro systems in mainland China, along with

the history of the metro in Hon Kong, is presented. Following that, some

observations based on the comparison of the development path Chinese
cities are

undertaking today is compared to the development path pursued by
American

cities following World War II.

</p>
#### A History of Public Transit in Mainland China

</p>
Current mode split in Chinese cities, as noted in Table 1, shows that
public transit (all forms)

currently has a mode capture of 19%. This share has likely increased
over the

last ten years as there has been significant construction of urban rail
systems

in the intervening time. In 2002, in addition to Hong Kong, there were
four cities

in mainland China with operating metro systems: Beijing (opening in
1969),

Shanghai (opened in 1995), Guangzhou (opened in 1997), and Tianjin
(opened in

1984\) and systems in Shenzhen, Nanjing, Chongqing, and Wuhan were under

construction *([2](#Ken01))*. Today there are 10

cities with metro systems in operation (Dalian and Shenyang, in addition
to the

above noted cities). Many of China’s large cities had laid out ambitious
metro

construction plans, however, in 1995, China’s State Council suspended
most

applications for construction, beyond those for Shanghai, Guangzhou, and

Beijing. There were two major concerns: a low number of passengers and
high

construction and maintenance costs. The former is due in part a lack of
an

integrated public transit fare system and the latter due to varied
technical

specifications and the need to import nearly all construction equipment
and

rolling stock. To combat the latter, when the moratorium on metro
construction

was lifted in May 1999 by the Chinese State Council, it came with the
condition

that new systems must have a domestic content of 60% or better
*([2](#Ken01))*. Further refined in

September 2003, the General Office of State Council stated that only
cities

with a population over 3 million, an annual budget of at least \$1.5
billion and

GDP of over \$15 billion would be approved for subway lines with a
one-way capacity

over 30,000 people/hour and only cities with a population over 1.5
million, a

annual budget of at least \$850 million and a GDP of over \$8.5 billion
would be

approved for light rail projects with a one-way capacity over 10,000

people/hour *([1](#IBI10))*.

It is worth noting that, by annual ridership, the Beijing (\#5), Hong

Kong (\#8), and Shanghai (\#9) systems are in the top ten systems
worldwide. Guangzhou is ranked \#15 *([3](#Wik10a))*. Recent

reports suggest that Shanghai currently has more passengers than Beijing
*([1](#IBI10))*. The four biggest

players in mainland China remain Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen
(market

share for 2010 noted in Table 2, which together account for 64% of
Chinese

urban rail passengers *([1](#IBI10))*).

Today, there

are over 100 cities in China with a population of over 1 million but
only ten

cities have either subway (metro) or light rail systems in operation
while thirty have

rail transit projects in either the planning or preparatory work stage,
meaning

that the potential explanation of rail transit in China is huge. Today,
the

four biggest players remain Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen
(market

share for 2010 noted in Table 2), which

together account for 64% of Chinese urban rail passengers
*([1](#IBI10))*. Probably in light of the fact that 50% of the

country’s population is expected to be urban by 2020 and 75% by 2050,
major

expansion of urban rapid transit has begun in China. The Chinese central

government has committed to spending USD 1 trillion by 2015 on
grade-separated

urban transportation corridors. This is expected to increase the length
of

urban rail from the 600 miles (975 km) today to 1,900 miles (3,075 km)
in five

years. The image below provides an overview of the cities that will see
this

investment *([4](#Yon10))* (click on the image to see an enlarged

The Beijing Metro was the country’s first, originally planned with the

help of Soviet experts and the concept originally unveiled in 1953.
Chinese

planners took particular interest in the use of the Moscow Metro during
the

Battle of Moscow during World War II, and so the Beijing Metro was
designed

from the very beginning to serve both civilian and military ends.
Increasing

tensions between the Soviet Union and China led to Soviet experts slowly
being

withdrawn in 1960 and completely removed by 1963. Determined to press
ahead,

the metro opened in 1969 to mark the 20^th^ anniversary of the

founding of the People’s Republic of China *([5](#Wik10b))*. The
original system

was designed with the ability to transport 5 to 6 divisions from Xishan
to

Beijing in the case of a Soviet invasion. To this day there remains two

stations at Xishan that are reserved for military use and not open to
the

public *([6](#cit06))*.

</p>
The system was opened to the general public in 1977 and to foreign

visitors in 1980 *([6](#cit06))*. For many years, the

expansion of the system was slow or non-existent. Winning the Olympic
bid in

2001 for the 2008 Summer Games provided a catalyst for investment,
resulting

in seven more lines opening, bringing the total to nine. Today (2010),
there are

nine lines open (Line 1, Line 2, Line 4, Line 5, Line 10, the Olympic
Branch

Line (Line 8, Phase I), Line Batong, and the Airport Express line)
representing

147 stations and 228 km of track *([5](#Wik10b))*. Line 4 is the last

of these to open in September 2009 and represents a joint venture with
the Hong

Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR). MTR owns a 49% stake in the project,
was

required to provide 30% of the capital, and will receive a concession to
run the

line for 30 years *([7](#MTR09a))*.

</p>
The Chinese Central Government has made continued investment in urban

public rail a priority, in part to try to relive pressure created by
increasing

urban populations and car ownership. There are currently 10 additional
lines under

construction in Beijing, with the construction of two more expected to
begin

this year. This will bring the system length to 420 km by 2012 and to
561 km by

2020 *([8](#Peo08))*. Below is a diagram of the proposed system to be in
place

by 2020 (not 2015, as noted in the diagram).

The Tianjin

Metro was the second to open in China, opening the first few stations in
1976 and the first line being completed eight years later

in 1984. The impetus had been the increasing number of motor vehicles,
particularly

trucks, in the 1950’s, which was causing the existing surface tram
system to

cease working effectively. Much of the system was constructed in a
former

canal. The system was slowly expanded during the 1970’s and 80’s, but by
the

end of the 1990’s, the systems was very much out of date, and so closed
in

September 2001 for renovations and reopened five years later in December
of

2006\. Today, there are 22 stations on three lines (Line 1, Line 9 and
the TEDA

MGRT) and 26 km of track. Lines 2 (opening 2011), 3 (opening 2012), 5
(opening

2013), and 6 (opening 2013) are currently under construction, and Lines
4, 7,

and 8 remain in the planning stages *([10](#Wik10c))*. Below is a map of

the Tianjin Metro system.

#### Shanghai

</p>
Shanghai has a rich history, rising to particular importance following

the Opium Wars (1839-42), after which it was opened to foreign trade. In
the

years that followed until World War II, Shanghai rose to become a global

financial center. In the wake of the Communist victory of the Chinese
Civil War

in 1949 brought closure of Shanghai to much of the rest of the world,
but the

economic librations of the 1980’s and 90’s brought redevelopment and
eventually

foreign investment. In 2005, Shanghai became the world’s largest port
*([12](#Wik10e))*. Today, Shanghai is

well on its way to reclaiming its spot as an important world city.

The first line of the Shanghai Metro opened in 1995 as a north-south

axis from the Central Station to the southern suburbs. In recent years,
the metro

system in Shanghai has undergone a significant expansion and is now the
world’s

largest system. In 2007, the system was comprised of over 250 km of
track and

moved 814 million passengers annually. By comparison, in 2000, the
system has

only 63 km of track and moved only 136 million passengers annually. This

corresponds to a mode capture of 5% in 2000 and 22% in 2007
*([1](#IBI10))*. The World Expo,

being held May 1 to October 31, 2010, has lead to a significant
investment in

Shanghai’s metro system, with six lines either built or significantly
expanded

in preparation. Today there is over 420 km of track on 12 lines with 268

stations, in addition to a short maglev line that runs from the airport.
By

2020, it is anticipated that there will be 22 lines in operation with
877 km of

track (see below) *([13](#Wik10f))*.

Shanghai’s metro system is unique in China in that it runs on 1,500V DC

power and is powered via overhead cantery, in part because of the high
voltage

(most metro systems run on 750 V DC and are powered via a third rail)
*([15](#Rob04b))*.

</p>
#### Guangzhou

</p>
With a history stretching back more than 2100 years, Guangzhou has a

varied and rich history. Established during the Qin dynasty as a
provincial

capital in AD 214, Guangzhou is known for its shipbuilding industry and
its

port over the centuries. Indeed, in the years leading up to the Opium
Wars

(1839-42) it was the only port open to the West. Guangzhou has struggled
in

modern times as, for various reasons, the port was closed to the outside
world.

Starting with China’s economic reforms in the last 1970’s and its
designation

in 1984 as an ‘open city’, Guangzhou has sought to reclaim its past
glory and

importance. Guangzhou, at the center of the Pearl River Delta, faces
tough

competition in this regard from both Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Metro
construction

is one part of a plan launched in 1997 to restore the city image and
remake it

into a regional hub for southeast China and Southeast Asia
*([16](#Jia03))*.

The construction of the Metro in Guangzhou began in December 1993 and
the

first line was completed in June 1999. It was a turnkey project, led by
Siemens,

with 16 stations and a total track length of 18.5 km *([17](#Rob07))*.
Metro Line 2 began

construction the same year and entered service in June of 2003
*([18](#Gua06))*. Currently

there are five lines open with 80 stations and over 150 km of track.
There are

three lines under construction with four more in planning stages. The
system is

expected to grow to 191 km by 2010 (see below for 2013 system) and over
600 km

in the long term.

#### Shenzhen

</p>
Before 1979, Shenzhen was a sleepy fishing village with a population of

300,000. That year brought Shenzhen the designation as the first of
China’s

Special Economic Zones, in part to serve as a buffer between Hong Kong
and

mainland China. Today, it has a population of 14 million and in 2009 was
ranked

as the number five financial center in the world after London, New York,
Hong

Kong, and Singapore *([20](#Edd10))*.

The

Shenzhen Metro opened in December 2004, the fifth city in mainland China
to

open a metro. The metro system currently has 2 lines with 22 stations
and 25 km

of track in use. It is anticipated that there will be 177 km of track in

service by 2011 (see below) *([21](#Wik10d))*. Plans of the expanded

2020 system can also be found below.

Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997 when it was handed back to

China, but has continued to maintain a political and economic system
much

different than that found in mainland China. As such, the history of
Hong

Kong’s metro system is much different than systems in mainland China.
The Hong

Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR) opened in 1979 as a result of a 1967
government

study began as an effort to ease the territory’s growing traffic
problem. In

2006, a merger of the operations of MTR and the Kowloon-Canton Railway
Company (KCR)

(providing rail service to the New Territories and Guangzhou and light
rail in

the New Territories) was effectuated, with merger of payment systems
competed

in December 2007. Today, the combined MTR network includes 212 km of
rail with 150 stations

*([24](#Wik10))* and is the most

commonly used transportation option in Hong Kong, capturing 42% of the
public

transportation market *([25](#MTR09))*. Hong Kong has a

highly developed public transportation systems which has a mode capture
rate of

more than 80%, one of the highest rates in the world *([26](#Wan10))*.
Hong Kong’s Metro

system is undergoing an expansion, although much smaller than many
mainland Chinese

cities (a map of the expanded network can be found in below), due, no
doubt in

part, to the already extensive nature of the system.

</p>
#### Success with Transportation-Oriented Development in Hong Kong

</p>
MTR has branched beyond solely providing public transit and has become a

major land developer in Hong Kong, often developing the immediate area
of new

stations. In fact, in 2009, MTR made more profit from property
management (HK\$3.55

billion) than from transport operations (HK\$2.12 billion)
*([25](#MTR09))*.

</p>
Much of the success of MTR is believed to relate to the high density of

both workers and population near MTR stations with over 20% of housing
units lying

within 200 m of an MTR station, and over 43% within 500m. This means
that some

2.78 million people live within 500 m of a station. Each public housing
unit within 500 m of

an MTR stations accounts for 1.97 passengers per day and each private
housing

unit accounts for 1.62 passengers per day. Mixed land use surrounding
stations,

as well as high densities, are highlighted as part of the success of
MTR. MTR also,

in its developments, aims to minimize ‘unnecessary transportation’ by
avoid

deliberately place facilities (such as schools or shops) beyond walking

distance, where possible *([28](#Tan04))*.

</p>
#### Moving Forward

</p>
Growth of megacities and regions means that to fully understand the

urban transportation picture, intercity rail links must be considered,

especially in light of China’s High Speed Rail (HSR) push. HSR has the
possibility

of expanding the effective area of a metropolitan to a radius of 200 km
or

more, as demonstrated by Paris and others.

</p>
Because of the pace at which China is building, finding up-to-date and

accurate information is nearly impossible. There are many forecasts for
the

2010 systems made 2-5 years ago, but it is hard to confirm what has
opened and

what is still under construction, and what never made it off the drawing
board

(e.g. the Maglev expansion to the Expo 2010 site in Shanghai). Current
plans

typically provide current system data and plans up to 2012, which seems
to be

the end of the current building cycle. What will happen after is
anyone’s guess.

The current building spree has been launched and accelerated by the
stimulus

package from the Chinese central government, a common response to the
current

economic climate by many governments worldwide, however China has
typically

spent enormous amounts of money – by some estimates, 10% of their GDP –
each

year on infrastructure, even in ‘normal’ years. This pace has meant that
<a< p>

href="http://en.wikipedia.com"\>Wikipedia</a> and public

transportation blogs, particularly <a< p>

href="http://www.thetransportpolitic.com"\>The Transport Politic</a>,
are vital

to understanding the current situation in China, due to their ability to
be

updated as events unfold, rather than the 6-12 month publishing cycle
typical of

peer-reviewed papers. In fact, between drafts of this paper, the
Transport

Politic published a summary *([4](#Yon10))* of the state of

public rail transit in China that radically changed the conclusions of
this

paper.

</p>
For now, Chinese cities have continued to grow at phenomenal rates, due

almost exclusively from in migration (as opposed to natural growth).
This,

combined with the rapid growth in the Chinese economy, has made it easy
to

support ambitious infrastructure projects. However, the Chinese would do
well

to remember the lessons that have been learnt in the United States. The
US once

had compact cities, including ‘streetcar suburbs.’ In the years
following World

War II, American cities blossomed, with a rising population (mostly due
to

natural growth in this case), an expanding economy, and an expanding
middle

class. Against this backdrop, American cities became increasingly
fordist,

separating land uses into separate zones which increased travel demand,
and which,

because of distance, was typically filled by the use of private motor
vehicles. Today,

much of that momentum has waned, leaving grand projects such as the
Eisenhower Interstate

System of yesteryear and the any proposed national HSR network to
languish in

political no-man’s land. While the debate continues, existing urban and

transportation infrastructure becomes increasingly fragile as
infrastructure

maintenance funding is diverted to more politically ‘sexy’ programs and
much of

the existing infrastructure built in the 1950’s and ’60’s nears the end
of its 50-75 estimated lifespan.

</p>
China, with cities whose population is often a magnitude of order larger

than their American counterparts in 1950, has already started to run
into the

traffic congestion problems and space constraints for transportation

infrastructure that took much longer to develop in America. In cities
such as

Beijing and Shanghai, public transit is seen, at least in part, as an
answer.

Chinese cities, as they develop and redevelop, would to do well to
remember the

guiding principal of reducing the need for trips to begin with, which
has worked

exceptionally well for Hong Kong’s MTR in particular, and Hong Kong as a
whole.

</p>
#### Conclusion

</p>
Public transit is an area of high growth in China. As an example,

Shanghai went from lacking an operational metro system before 1995 to
having the world’s

largest system today in 2010. The sheer size of the Chinese population
has meant that

expansions to existing systems, as well as metro systems in new cities,
are

often at capacity soon upon completion. This is typical of Chinese
cities,

although the scale of Shanghai (population of 19 million) has made the
rise of

its metro system particularly remarkable. In short, at the present time,

Chinese cities, including their public transit systems, are in a growth
phase.

</p>
The caution is given to Chinese planners to consider long-term

implications of their transportation network choices and to learn from

international experience. Hong Kong has seen much success in reducing
private

automobile use through the use of urban public rail and so can be
considered an

example both to Chinese cities and the rest of the world. American
cities, by

contrast, choose to expand their highway systems during a period of
strong

growth following World War II and today have a transportation system
that is

nearly its limits, both in terms of capacity and life cycle. Chinese
cities,

and growing cities worldwide, do well to consider the long term impact
of their

transportation network choices of today.
