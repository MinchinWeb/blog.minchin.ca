The Second World War marked France profoundly as many of the battles
took place here. Not wanting to forget the sacrifice of so many, little
signs commemorating those fallen dot France. (Next time you're in Paris,
if you look for them; you'll probably see several). In this vain, there
are a number of plaques memorializing the failed 'Operation Jubilee'
that brought nearly 6000 Canadian troops to Dieppe of which only half
would return at the end of the day to Britain. That said, several have
claimed that the D-Day Landings in Normandy two years later succeed in
large part because of the lessons learned at Dieppe.

The plaque reads:

<div markdown=1 class="text-center">
LE DIX NEUF AOUT MIL NEUF CENT QUARTANTE DEUX  
SUR LA PLAGE DE DEIPPE  
NOS COUSIN CANADIENS  
TRACERENT LEUR SANG  
LA VOIE DE NOTRE LIBERATION FINAL  
PRESAGENT AINSI LEUR RETOUR VICTORIEUX  
DU PREMIER SEPTEMBRE MIL NEUF CENT QUARTANTE QUATRE  
</div>

The translation of the plaque:

<div markdown=1 class="text-center">
The 19<sup>th</sup> of August, 1945  
on the beaches of Dieppe  
Our Canadian cousins  
Traced in their blood  
the path to our final liberation  
Passing for their victorious return
