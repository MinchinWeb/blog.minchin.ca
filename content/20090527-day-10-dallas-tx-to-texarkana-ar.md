*Tuesday, May 5, 2009*

So I woke up this morning in Dallas, Texas. On one hand, it's rather
weird to be here because up until a few days ago, this was a place I
read about in books, not looked out the window to see. It was fun when I
pulled in last night because they family I'm staying with here had a
Western on the TV, and it looked just like west Texas that I had spent
the morning driving across. From here, the trip is a lot more open. I
have four days to get to Montreal, and just about any way I cut it, it
will probably take most of that time to get there. I little bit of
playing with Google Maps and I came up with this (potential) itinerary:

-   Day 1: St Louis MO -- 1068km -- 10h01
-   Day 2: Lansing MI -- 801 km -- 7h43
-   Day 3: Palmyra NY -- 674 km -- 6h53
-   Day 4: Montreal -- 502km -- 5h17

I rather enjoyed a lazy morning and the company at hand, and so it was
into the afternoon before I got away. The one stop I wanted to make was
Minchin, Texas ([punch it in
Mapquest...](http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Minchin&state=TX#a/maps/m::7:33.00625:-97.065908:0:::::/e)).
I turned down Roselawn Lane, which is where the map shows it should be,
but could find no reference at all to "Minchin" at all. I ended up
heading into town and tried the Chamber of Commerce and the Library
(they have a genealogy section), but found nothing there. When I get a
chance, I'll have to write the local museum and see if they can tell me
anything.

Finally leaving the Dallas area, it was almost supper time, but I drove
for about half an hour and found this place (actually a chain
restaurant) called the "Texas Roadhouse" and figured it would be quite
appropriate to eat steak in Texas. Steak was great, but by then it was
dark when I finished. I decided to head east on US-82, for the main
reason it would take me through Paris! I finished off the night just on
the Arkansas-Texas border, got a room in Texarkana, and decided to call
it a night.
