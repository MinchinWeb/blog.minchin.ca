Quick on the heals of the [release of version
7]({filename}20140301-metalibrary-version-7-for-openttd-released.md), version 8
of *MetaLibrary* has been released.

To recap, *MetaLibrary* is a collection of code I've written to simplify
writing an AI for [OpenTTD](http://www.openttd.org/), a remake of my childhood
favorite, Transport Tycoon.

Version 8 brings a 9-30x improvement in the speed of *Lakes*, and by extension,
a speed-up in the Ship Pathfinder. And that's all for now; I figured that would
be enough. The [documentation for
MetaLibrary](http://minchin.ca/openttd-metalibrary/) has also been updated.
