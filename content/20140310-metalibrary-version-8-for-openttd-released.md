Quick on the heals of the [release of version
7](http://blog.minchin.ca/2014/03/metalibrary-version-7-for-openttd.html),
version 8 of *MetaLibrary* has been released.

To recap, *MetaLibrary* is a collection of code I've written to simplify
writing an AI for [OpenTTD](http://www.openttd.org/), a remake of my
childhood favorite, Transport Tycoon.

Version 8 brings a 9-30x improvement in the speed of *Lakes*, and by
extension, a speed-up in the Ship Pathfinder. And that's all for now; I
figured that would be enough. The [documentation for
MetaLibrary](http://minchin.ca/openttd-metalibrary/) has also been
updated.
