> Europe at night, showing the change in illumination from 1993-2003. This data
> is based on satellite observations. Lights are colour-coded. Red lights
> appeared during that period. Orange and yellow areas are regions of high and
> low intensity lighting respectively that increased in brightness over the ten
> years. Grey areas are unchanged. Pale blue and dark blue areas are of low and
> high intensity lighting that decreased in brightness. Very dark blue areas
> were present in 1993 and had disappeared by 2003. Much of western and central
> Europe has brightened considerably. Some North Sea gas fields closed in the
> period.
