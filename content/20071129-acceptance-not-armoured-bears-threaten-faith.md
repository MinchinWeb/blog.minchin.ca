*This is written as a response to an article in the November 26, 2007
edition of the University of Alberta student newspaper, "[The
Gateway](http://www.thegatewayonline.ca/)" entitled "[Armoured bears
don't threaten
faith](http://www.thegatewayonline.ca/armoured-bears-don-t-threaten-faith-20071126-1466.html)"
by Ryan Heise.*

As a regular reader of the Gateway, I have read a fair share of ideas
that are a little thought and controversy producing pieces, but thought
I would add a little to the mix myself. I was reading the Editorial
entitled "[Armoured bears don't threaten
faith](http://www.thegatewayonline.ca/armoured-bears-don-t-threaten-faith-20071126-1466.html)"
by Ryan Heise in the November 26 edition. Although he raises some valid
points, I think he has been rather simplistic and one-sided.

I think my biggest issue with Heise's conclusion that religion should be
a private affair. Having lived in France for two years, I would like to
refer to it as an example. In 1905, France passed a
[law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905_French_law_on_the_separation_of_Church_and_State%20)
that brought about separation of State and religion, but it did much
more. The State was declared
"[laÃ¯que](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%C3%AFcit%C3%A9)", which
roughly translates as "secular"; it was declared illegal to discuss
religion (or politics, for the matter) at your place of employment.
Religion was declared, in effect, to be a private matter. Interacting
with the French, it is interesting to see the transformation that has
taken place over the last three generations. To generalize broadly,
people our grandparents age are strong in their Catholic faith; people
our parents age are often Catholic in tradition only, attending church
for events like baptisms, weddings, and funerals only; people our age
often can't be bothered to ask the question, they were baptized Catholic
by their parents but have little more to do with the Church after that.
Would this not be a proselyting atheist's dream come true? If anything,
my experience in France has taught me that when religion is declared a
private affair having little or no place in public life, religious
sentiment among the masses quickly fades.

That being said, I think what we need is tolerance, not to shuffle
religion out of our public lives. But tolerance is not the same as
acceptance. If we go to the definitions, we find
[tolerance](http://www.answers.com/tolerance&r=67) means "the capacity
for or the practice of recognizing and respecting the beliefs or
practices of others," while
[acceptance](http://www.answers.com/acceptance) is defined as
"Favourable reception; approval" or "Belief in something; agreement." In
short, what we need in the world is respect, but we also need to be
willing to make judgment calls about the things around us. In academic
endeavours, it is readily accepted that some work is of higher merit
than others, and the marks given out are expected to represent that. We
need more of that same evaluation when it comes to the moral issues in
our lives -- a willingness to declare one thing to be of worth and
another to be rubbish, and the respect that allows others to consider
the same situation and come to another conclusion, and then agree to
disagree if required.

But do not let not my words be misunderstood -- I am not condoning or
even suggesting that everything your aforementioned "Christian groups"
do is in line with my beliefs. Instead, what I am suggesting is that
conversation is an important one to society as a whole. And I would much
rather the discussion take the form of heated words, rather than the
violence and terror that other groups have resorted to.

Modern society has brought us many wonderful things, but I think we have
lost a great deal if our religious beliefs cannot be publicly displayed
and defended. I think of the words of General Omar N. Bradley, a World
War II general, who said

> We have too many men of science; too few men of God. We have grasped
> the mystery of the atom and rejected the Sermon on the Mount. Man is
> stumbling blindly through a spiritual darkness while toying with the
> precarious secrets of life and death. The world has achieved
> brilliance without wisdom, power without conscience. Ours is a world
> of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war than we
> know about peace, more about killing than we know about living.

My hope is that we become "men of learning" during our time here, that
we not forsake the spiritual learning that we brought with us to
university, and that both may be a strength to us and serve us well as
we leave these halls of learning.
