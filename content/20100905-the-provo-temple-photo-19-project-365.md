I took a trip and so was without internet access for a while, so now I'm
in the process of catching up. It's a little harder to remember the
stories two weeks (sometimes more), but I'll try my best. As always,
enjoy!

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

The Provo Temple at night is beautiful when lit up at night, and even

This was also taken with my zoom lens - next time I'm taking my tripod
to improve my odds of getting good night photos.
