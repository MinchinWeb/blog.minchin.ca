Still in the National Parks between Banff and Jasper, I found this
waterfall. The effect I was going for here was one of fluid motion - by
setting a (relatively) long shutter speed (a tenth of a second, in this
case), the motion of the water is captured. At the other extreme, with
an extremely fast shutter speed, you can freeze a waterfall, making it
look almost as if it had turned to ice in an instant.\

#### Project Update

</p>
So this is the end of my first batch of 'Project 365' photos - 98 photos
that have taken over two years to be put up. I realize that is a far cry
from the original plan of a photo a day for a year. I can blame part of
the backlog on moving five times and the following periods without
internet, but regardless, I am through that backlog. Now I can post
pictures closer to when I take them and hopefully offer more meaningful
commentary. In short, I look forward to posting more pictures here
soon!\
