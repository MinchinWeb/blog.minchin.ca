Note to self: When you take your camera out to take pictures, make sure
you have a memory card to store said pictures!

So this is actually my second try at taking photos today, and I wonder
if I could have got something with my other lenses... But in any case,
here I present to you the flowers! The shot is simple enough, but I like
the effect of the muted background behind.

So tomorrow, I bring the lenses and the memory card...
