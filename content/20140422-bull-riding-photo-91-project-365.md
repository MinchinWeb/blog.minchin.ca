If barrel racing is about finesse, bull riding is about sheer power.
Holding on with only hand, the rider aims to stay on for eight seconds.
A surprising few make it. Those that do stand a chance at rodeo glory.

I liked this photo because it freezes the bull's action so well, legs
and in the air and rope flying, hinting at the bull's power. It's
interesting to note the number of people around the periphery, watching
attentively and ready to jump into action at the first sign of trouble
to rescue the bull rider.
