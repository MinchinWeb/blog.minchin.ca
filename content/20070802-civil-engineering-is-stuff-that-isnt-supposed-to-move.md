If you missed it in the news, the bridge that takes I-35W across the
Mississippi River in Minneapolis fell into the river last night. If you
want a full report, you'll have to look elsewhere (I can point you to
[CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/08/02/bridge-collapse.html "CBC"));
some highlights:

[![I-35W Bridge Collapse](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fWUoqQ2t4Js/RrK9CM-EJ5I/AAAAAAAAAdA/HNpPj4qUMN8/s200/I-35W+bridge+collapse+TLR1.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fWUoqQ2t4Js/RrK9CM-EJ5I/AAAAAAAAAdA/HNpPj4qUMN8/s1600-h/I-35W+bridge+collapse+TLR1.jpg)

-   the bridge was built in 1967
-   I-35W is a major artery through Minneapolis; the bridge is 8 lanes
    wide and reportedly carries over 200,000 vehicles a day
-   the bridge collapsed towards the end of the evening rush hour, about
    7pm local time; and very suddenly (the center section collapsed in 4
    seconds)
-   the cause of the collapse is unknown at present
    -   A 2005 report rated the bridge as "structurally deficient" (a
        category with 70,000+ other American bridges)
    -   a more recent report suggested that the bridge, in its current
        state, would likely be serviceable though to 2020
    -   the bridge was undergoing non-structural repair work at the
        time, which started the night before
    -   a loaded freight train was running under the bridge at the time
    -   the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI have stated that
        it does not appear to be sabotage or terrorist related; security
        footage does not show any smoke that would be characteristic of
        an explosion
-   the death toll currently (Thursday noon) is 7, although that is
    expected to rise as bodies are pulled from the river; 79 are
    reported injured; 20 to 30 people are reported missing

It will be a few days before everything gets sorted out; for now I
imagine people are still in shock and not quite sure what to do. At the
end of the investigation (which may take a year or more), the panel will
conclude either it was a freak accident, or will give a number of
guidelines to keep this from happening again.

Unfortunately, this isn't the first time a bridge has collapsed - we
only need to look back to last October when the [de la Concorde freeway
collapsed](http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=ee2d0ff1-b2c3-40a6-bc8c-d6a5e8da2c55 "de la Concorde freeway collasped")
in Laval, just out of Montreal. Unfortunately, [it seems unlikely that
this will be the last time we see this sort of
thing](http://news.com.com/Aging+infrastructure+at+heart+of+Minnesota+disaster/2100-1008_3-6200459.html?tag=nefd.lede "Aging infrastructure at heart of Minnesota disaster | CNET News").
So what is the difference between a bridge that is 40 years old and
expected to last another 15 at least, and the computer monitor that
you're reading this on, which is likely less than two years old, and
will likely find itself replaced within that much time going forward? I
would suggest that the difference is what we expect of our engineers,
our civil engineering in particular.

Part one is the [Code of
Ethics](http://www.apegga.com/About/ACT/code.htm "Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta (APEGGA)'s Code of Ethics").
Engineers are professionals, whose foremost concern is the welfare of
the public. Engineers are part of provincial associations that have
developed a Code of Ethics to this end. These associations are
self-governing, meaning they have the power to remove members for
violations of the Code of Ethics. This means that if an Engineer
disregards the public welfare, or doesn't properly perform his duties or
due diligence, even if he doesn't face criminal charges, he can have his
permit to practice engineering, which is probably his livelihood,
revoked. Becuase of this, the Code of Ethics has become a touchstone in
both the day-to-day and the extraordinary decisions an engineer will
face.

Part two is there is almost no allowance for failure. Most people are
shocked when they learn that the space shuttle missions are given a 1 in
50 chance of not coming home (at 1 in about 75, they're beating those
odds) because they would never accept that in their homes, offices,
bridges, or dams. We expect that civil engineering projects will
perform, no ifs, and, or buts. The downside of that is technological
change can be very slow, as everyone wants to use the methods that are
time tested. Although we're fine with replacing our computer every
couple of years, we expect our house to last forever.

But engineers are up to the task. If the report suggests changes in how
engineering work is performed, I have no doubt there will be changes.
Failures provide the chance to learn. No engineer would claim to
understand every natural law, and thus all design work is completed
using a factor of safety, which can be as large as 3. That means that
the sturcture is designed to withstand three times its expected load.
This is done to cover off the unexpected, the un-understood, and the
unknown. The Quebec Bridge failures of 1907 and 1916 [fundamentally
changed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Bridge#Aftermath "fundamentally changed")
the way engineers in Canada went about their work, and the redesigned
bridge stands yet today as the longest cantilever bridge span in the
world. In Canada, the [Ritual of the Calling of the
Engineer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ritual_of_the_Calling_of_an_Engineer "Ritual of the Calling of the Engineer")
was set up shortly afterwards, and folklore says that the Iron Rings
presented are made of the failed Quebec Bridge to serve as a reminder to
him of his obligation to the public.

So I have faith in our Civil Engineers and their work. If there's a
problem, I trust they'll fix it. I'll see you on the other side of that
bridge!
