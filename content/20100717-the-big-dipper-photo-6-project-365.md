I went for a walk tonight and ended with a beautiful picture of the Big
Dipper. I've always loved to look at the stars...

I tried different settings, but ended up settling on my first snapshot.
I don't think the picture is in focus (Auto-focus didn't work in because
there was so little light), but I like the effect of the out-of-focus
stars - it makes them central to the photo. Taking photos at night is
hard too because the camera has a tendency to turn the sky maroon if the
exposure goes too long.
