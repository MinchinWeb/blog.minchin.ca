We are now finished up the second Christmas season overshadowed by Covid (and
hopefully the last!).

On one hand, it provides a nice excuse to stay home and have a quiet holiday.
But it's also been almost two years since we've been able to visit some
extended family due to border closures. We ended up in the middle: we had some
extended family travel this way, and other family gatherings happened, although
with several absences due to people in Covid quarantine.

The Christmas/holiday season has been extended by at least a week, as they
kids' school has been closed for this week to try and help control the Covid
spread. It's nice to have them home, but the logistics of it get a little hairy
with both parents working....

On a non-Covid note, this Christmas season has been frightening cold. I think
we're going on two weeks now without a single day about -20&deg;C. The good news
is that the car even managed to start at -38&deg;C! Although it is finally
forecast to get to 0&deg;C next week. :)

Looking forward, we're seriously looking at an international trip this summer.
We're sort of betting that the Covid situration will be mostly under control
both 'here' and 'there' in six months. We actually had our flights selected two
weeks ago, but the night before I went to put my money down, the Covid rules
changed, meaning that wouldn't be able to take our full trip proposed under the
new rules. We reviewed the cancellation rules and figure the Covid rules
will change (several times) before our trip, so we're going to lock down
tickets as soon as the travel agent returns from holidays.

More broadly, one of the longer-term Covid effects -- its destructive effect on
individual's religious faith -- is sadly starting to show. When Covid first
struck, I figured that if Covid lockdowns (and thus only virtual church
meetings) went on for sometime, some of the congregation members would drift
away. For some, the (physical) church meetings was the extent of the religious
expression in the best of times. But for many others, meeting with and being
physically present with their fellow believers served to regularly strengthen
their faith, to find faithful answers the questions that arose from daily life,
and to help put their doubts behind them; to be cut off from this strength and
continue faithful requires developing and maintaining an independent, internal
source of strength and faith. Against this background, I've had several friends
(4 come to mind in the last month or so) that have declared their departure
from the Faith; none of them have even hinted that Covid was what brought this
about, but that is the backdrop these things are happening against. To have
predicted this doesn't mean it's still not sad to see it happen.

Hopefully, the Covid will soon be behind us. May warm days soon be yours.
