Oil is at an all-time high, and everything seems to be pointing to the
price to [keep going
up](http://blog.wired.com/cars/2008/04/4-a-gallon-gas.html). So what
does that mean to you and I over the next few years?

## Oil -- Driving Economics & Politics

Oil for long has been called "Black Gold", and which current prices, a
full out gold rush is upon us, boom towns (i.e. [Fort
McMurray](http://www.economist.com/world/la/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9410672 "Boomtown on a bender - The Economist"))
and all. The value of these deposits will give economic power to the
regions so endowed. Russia has been accused of using its oil and gas
reserves for [political
purposes](http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/09/business/secure.php).
Closer to home,
[Alberta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athabasca_Oil_Sands) has become
an oil powerhouse, with Saskatchewan, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia
poised to join the club -- and the combination has made Canada the
largest foreign supplier of oil to the United States.

## What's Under the Hood?

As gas prices rise, alternate fuels start to look more and more
attractive. Corn ethanol has been pushed in the States for some time,
but is [highly
subsidized](http://www.taxpayer.net/energy/ethanolprimer.pdf). Don't be
surprised to hear about ethanol from some "weird" sources in the future.
The Holy Grail would be to find a way to use an industrial waste product
like [wood chips or waste
paper](http://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/magazine/15-10/ff_plant).
Other technologies to watch include plug-in cars,
[hybrids](http://www.wired.com/cars/futuretransport/news/2008/01/lutz_volt_qa)
(battery technologies), [fuels cells](http://www.ballard.com/),
hydrogen, and stuff coming out of left field that is unheard of today.

The increasing price point will also mean that those transporters who
can benefit most from economies of scale, like railways, will become
increasing competitive. Look for a rail yard expansion coming to a city
near you.

## Urban Renewal

As commuting gets more and more expensive, people are going to start
reconsidering how far they want to go, and how they want to go the
distance. Expect to see an increased interest in public transit, new and
in-fill developments increasingly being built around public
transportation systems, especially light rail, and an increased interest
in condo living downtown.

I can take myself as an example of this: about a year ago I moved from a
lovely place out of town to almost the center of town, a distance of
about 40km. I enjoy being able to walk to most things, and everything
else is a 10 minute drive. At today's gas prices, I figure I save myself
at least $250/month.

## Onshoring

Whether this will get hidden in general inflation or not is yet to be
seen, but since almost all consumer and industrial good are physically
transported, and thus the consumer will facer [higher prices for just
about
everything](http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/04/29/business/29prices.php).
Offshoring -- placing production plants far from markets, typically
overseas -- has been economical because wages offshore and transportation
have been cheap. As both rise, look for companies to consider moving
production back closer to markets -- typically North America and Europe.

## The Northwest Passage

The Arctic for many is written off as a vast, cold, snow-covered
wasteland, but it also contains the prize that brought Columbus and
[many
others](http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/northwpass/intro.html)
to the Americas -- the Northwest Passage. While [estimates
vary](http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/science/08/29/northwest.passage/index.html),
the consensus is the global warming will open up the currently ice-bound
passage to ocean-going vessels. The big deal is that going through
northern Canada is much shorter than going through the Panama Canal,
shaving 4000 miles off the trip from Europe to Asia!

## The Political Fallout

As the Northwest Passage opens up, the unresolved question of "Who
control the Passage?" will come to a head -- on one side, [Canada claims
the
passage](http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2007/08/arctics-legenda.html)
as internal waterways, while several other countries, including the
United States, claim the waterway as international waters. I hope that a
peaceful solution can be found before we have a human or ecological
disaster in the High Arctic due to lack of, or disregarded, rules.

The future seems to be upon us, while few things seem certain, the fact
that the future will be different that today and bring different
challenges seems certain. My faith is that, like Henry Ford stated long
ago, we have the capacity to overcome whatever challenges may face us.

To the future!
