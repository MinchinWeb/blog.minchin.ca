[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) is the "package index" for Python and a
wonderful tool for finding and sharing Python libraries.

On the index, there is a system of *trove classifiers* (see the [full list
here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers)) that serve to
allow package authors to tag their projects to help user find them. Some groups
classifiers cover the Python version targeted, the "development status" (alpha,
beta, stable, etc.), the license, the framework used, as so on.

Recently, trove classifiers for Pelican were added! This is great because it
will allow for better discover-ability of Pelican themes and plugins. So I've
re-released my collection of Pelican plugins and themes with the new
classifiers, so the following releases:

- [minchin.pelican.jinja_filters](https://github.com/MinchinWeb/minchin.pelican.jinja_filters) v1.0.4
- [minchin.pelican.plugins.cname](https://github.com/MinchinWeb/minchin.pelican.plugins.cname) v1.0.4
- [minchin.pelican.plugins.image_process](https://github.com/MinchinWeb/minchin.pelican.plugins.image_process) v1.1.2 (this release is broken, [version 1.1.3 has been released]({filename}20170527-image-processing-for-pelican-113-released.md))
- [minchin.pelican.plugins.nojekyll](https://github.com/MinchinWeb/minchin.pelican.plugins.nojekyll) v1.0.2
- [minchin.pelican.plugins.optimize_images](https://github.com/MinchinWeb/minchin.pelican.plugins.optimize_images) v1.1.1
- [minchin.pelican.plugins.post_stats](https://github.com/MinchinWeb/minchin.pelican.plugins.post_stats) v1.1.1
- [minchin.pelican.plugins.summary](https://github.com/MinchinWeb/minchin.pelican.plugins.summary) v1.1.1
- [seafoam](https://github.com/MinchinWeb/seafoam) v2.1.4

PyPI also has the ability to show you [everything tagged with
Pelican](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=browse&c=635).
