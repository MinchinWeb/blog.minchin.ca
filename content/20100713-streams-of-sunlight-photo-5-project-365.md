I went on a hike (and did a little bit of mountain climbing too) this
morning with my camera and so ended up with a ton of cool photos. I
was actually hard to decide which ONE to put up for today, but here it
is! We were up by a waterfall and the sun was streaming through the
trees above us. I managed to land just the right angle to get this
beautiful lens flare. Enjoy!
