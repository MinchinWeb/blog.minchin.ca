I've read this before, but I would have to say this passage of scripture
is among my favourites.

> For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my
> kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my
> peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.
>
> No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue
> that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is
> the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is
> of me, saith the LORD.
>
> -- [Isaiah 54:10](http://scriptures.lds.org/isa/54#10), [17](http://scriptures.lds.org/isa/54#17)

where I copied to text from to keep from retyping it all. They have the
whole King James Bible on-line. Click on "Gospel Library" and then "The
Scriptures" to get there.)

The Mormon Tabernacle Choir did a very nice song based on the first
verse on their CD <u>Consider the Lilies</u>. I just like it because it
reminds me of the promises the Lord has made to the faithful.
