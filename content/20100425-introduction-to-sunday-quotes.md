I've always been fascinated with quotes. Perhaps it is an offshoot of my
ability to remember randoms bits, but I've always appreciated the humour
or wisdom a good quote can bring. So, I've decided to share some of my
favorites, along with some personal comments, with you! I'd like for
them to appear regularly on Sundays, and it will be a while before I run
out of material, so there's hope for a good run. If there's a quote
you'd like to appear, [email me](mailto:minchinweb@gmail.com) and I'll
see what I can do. I'll start this week with a quote on the power of
love from Mother Teresa. Enjoy!
