The Weather Network claims that 80% of the population checks the weather
forecast, so they ask why not put the forecast on your site. Best of all
it's free! They have several options for shapes and sizes, but
basically, you put a little bit of code in your page, and voila. To hook
up, go to

Here's an example, useful for the bottom of a webpage:

<!--
<div style="text-align: center;">

<iframe marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" name="wxButtonFrame" id="wxButtonFrame" src="http://btn.weather.ca/weatherbutton/template4.php?placeCode=CABC0402&amp;category0=Cities&amp;placeCode1=CAAB0103&amp;category1=Cities&amp;placeCode2=CAMB0244&amp;category2=Cities&amp;placeCode3=CAON0696&amp;category3=Cities&amp;placeCode4=CANS0057&amp;category4=Cities&amp;containerWidth=384&amp;%09btnNo=3367&amp;backgroundColor=yellow&amp;multipleCity=1&amp;citySearch=1&amp;celsiusF=C" align="top" frameborder="0" height="20" scrolling="no" width="384"></iframe>

</div>
-->

Or add the Canadian map and see what the weather is like across the
country (clicking on a city will take you to the 4 day forecast on The
Weather Network's site). However, Blogger won't let me add the Java
Script tag needed to show you here.

You can go to [The Weather
Network](http://www.weathernetwork.com/inter/weathercentre/weatherbutton/index.htm)
hook your own webpage up.

I'll leave you with another fun quote I found:
