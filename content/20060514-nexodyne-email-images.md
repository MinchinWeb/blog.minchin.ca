With new technology, comes new concerns. In the case of electronic mail, it is
that of spam. At least when we get junk mail at home, we can quickly sort
through it and drop it into the recycle bin. The fact that you have to pay
someone to print and deliver the flyers does serve to deter companies from
filling up everyone's mailbox with non-addressed mail. Spam, on the other hand,
can be sent for almost free. I guess they must make some sales out of it, or
you would think that they would have given up on the tactics long ago. But
where do they get email addresses to spam? Unlike delivering flyers, where you
can just walk down the street, you have to actually know someone's email
address.

From what I've gathered over the years, spammers gather email address in three
main ways:

1. Ask you for it -- You are thinking, "I would never give my address to a
   spammer!" and you probably wouldn't, if you knew what you were doing.
   Sometimes websites will ask for your email address for mailing lists or
   registration, and then sell it over to spammers. Reading website's privacy
   policies can be helpful, and respectable websites realize this isn't a good
   way to keep up a reputation.
2. Find it on the web -- In much the same way that search engines go over the
   web, spammers can write little programs, called robots, that "crawl" the
   web, following the links on pages and sending the email address they find
   back. These addresses can be in the text you read when you view the web
   page, or it can be hidden away in the HTML coding that typically only web
   programmers, web browsers and robots care to look at. This is why many sites
   warn you not to post your email address on the web.
3. Buy it off someone else -- Sometimes spammers with a little money and less
   technical know-how or time will buy lists of email addresses. The advantage
   to this, for the spammer, is that you can get lists of "confirmed" emails.

So how do you get around this? The simplest way is just not to have an email
address, but for most of us, this isn't a practical solution. Another option,
as I did when I set up this website, is to have a "public" email. But I came
across an ingenious solution this last week - put your email in an image. This
works much the same way as "word verification" does on this site. As long as
you don't put your email in the name of the image or the alternate text, your
email is safely hidden away. Nexodyne provides a free service to do this
(<https://services.nexodyne.com/email/>). One of the cool things about this
website is that it will allow you to generate the image and save it locally,
and they provide an encrypted link that allows you to serve the image directly
off their server.

Here's the copy from their server:

<div class="text-center" markdown=1>

</div>

and the local copy:

<div class="text-center" markdown=1>

![Local Copy]({filename}images/2006/mail.png)

</div>

Very cool idea!
