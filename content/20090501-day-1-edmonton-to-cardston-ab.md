*Sunday, April 26, 2008*

My struggle with going on anything like this is figuring out what I
need, and then packing what I need without packing a ton of extra stuff
too. As I left, I made sure I had my passport, and I figure I can buy
just about anything else. There are a few things that didn't make it
into the van:

-   shampoo and conditioner
-   a baseball hat
-   combination locks -- this is really dumb because I bought them
    Saturday for this trip

The first day was mostly uneventful; I made it to Cardston like I'd
hoped to and made good time. It's kind of ridiculous, but when I left
Edmonton, it was snowing, and it snowed off and on until I was about
half an hour south of Calgary. Supper was at Peter's Drive-in, of
course.
