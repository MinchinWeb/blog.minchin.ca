Category: Pelican Plugins

*AutoLoader* is a plugin for [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/),
a static site generator written in Python.

*AutoLoader* is a "meta plugin" in that it doesn't directly affect your Pelican
site, but rather works to make your other plugins better. Prevously, the plugin
was set to autoload plugins in my `minchin.pelican.plugins` namespace, and thus
will extend that to my `minchin.pelican.readers` namespace.

This change is done in preparation for my (shortly) pending release of a
microblogging plugin for Pelican.

## Upgrading

The simplest way to upgrade (and install) *AutoLoader* is to use `pip`:

~~~sh
pip install minchin.pelican.plugins.autoloader --upgrade
~~~

## Configuration

There are no configuration changes needed.

## This Release

This release is v1.2.0, released July 11, 2023.

- **feature**: include autoloading from additional "private" namespace of
  `minchin.pelican.readers`.

## Known Issues

- plugins activated by *AutoLoader* do not show running `pelican-plugins`.
  (`pelican-plugins` was a script added by Pelican 4.5 to show namespace
  plugins currently active). *AutoLoader* however should be itself listed
  (although likely as `pelican.plugins.autoloader`).
