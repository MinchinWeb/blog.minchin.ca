A year ago, I traveled to southern France with my honey and some
friends. As we visited Marseilles, a port town on the Mediterranean with
a history stretching back some 2,600 years, we came to a plaque that
commemorated the start of that history. Along the old harbour, the
bronze reads "Here, in 600 BC, Greek sailors from Phocaea, a Greek city
in Asia Minor, landed. They founded Marseilles, to serve as a beacon of
civilization to the west."\

\

They next day we went hiking along the shore just east of the city.
Although the city was near, there were few signs of civilization here
beyond the path we followed. We would eat lunch in a beautiful secluded
cove, tucked away between the forest and the ocean spray.\

\

Two months ago, just after Christmas, I found myself on another
coastline, but this one on another ocean completely. I stood on
Vancouver Island. This time there was no plaque, although a statue of
George Vancouver sits atop the parliament building in Victoria. The
first Europeans, one of either the Russians, Spanish, or British, may
not have seen this shore until the 1770's. At Victoria, a busy city has
grown up, but the shoreline to the west quickly starts resembling what
it must have looked like 250 years ago.\

In both places, as I sat looking out over the ocean and listening to the
gently crashing surf, I wondered what kept me from pulling a stunt like
the Phocaeians of long ago? Buy a little boat, row to a forgotten or
unexplored shore, and just set up camp? I think the answer is the
common-law system of land ownership.\

\

Our current system of land ownership is a marvel and a mark of our
civilized society. So fundamental to our way of life, some say that
democracy could not exist without men being confident in their rights to
property. But our current land system has a couple of "gotcha's" thrown
in for good measure. Many of them stem from the fact that your right to
the land is traced back to someone who was granted that land by the
king. And while the king lets you sell the land or live on it for all
your days, he kept a couple of important powers, including taxation,
eminent domain, and escheat. A short review:\

-   **taxation** means owning property can make your liable for certain
    taxes, simply by virtue of owning that land. This is why if you stop
    paying your property taxes, the city ends up owning your house;
-   **eminent domain** (literally *supreme lordship* in Latin) allows
    the government to take your property back against your wishes,
    although usually with conditions like the proposed new use being in
    the public good and you being paid the market value for the property
    or otherwise being made whole (small comfort, right?); and
-   **escheat** allows the king to claim the property if you don't
    otherwise have an heir.

</p>
Some countries (like the US) have done away with the king, but kept the
powers. So the problem with borrowing a rowboat and claiming wherever
you make landfall is that some king (or republic) already claims it! In
the words of Canadian Foreign Minister Peter MacKay "This isn't the 15th
century. You can't go around the world and just plant flags and say
'We're claiming this territory'" ([though the Russians might try
anyway...](http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=3f4b4327-92a7-4043-ae95-3575763d7b08))\

\

So while my studies in flag design aren't going to be immediately
useful, I think I still like it this way. Civilized societies also
include in their set of land ownership rules rules that allow you to own
property *in absentia*, so if I wanted to (and could find the money
under my mattress), I could buy that piece of French or British
Colombian coast and not have to worry about my neighbour coming over and
taking it from me at the point of the sword. And I would much rather
that our metallurgists work at making taller skyscrapers rather than
pointier swords and stronger shields to protect their homes with.\

\

So I guess I take to saving up my pennies and find a good real estate
agent....\
