Part of the image of Europe gets built around the old things, including
the old stone homes from the days before 2x4 (lumber, wood-frame)
construction. This home is at Mont Saint Michel, a rock on the Normandy
coast that has had an abbey at the top of it for over 1000 years and a
village built in stone under it for almost as long. As a side, Mt St
Michel is one of my favorite places to visit in France.
