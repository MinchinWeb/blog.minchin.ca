This is one of those pictures meant open a portal onto daily life...\

In France, many people (including me when I was there) live in low-rise
apartment buildings. Typically, they are three to six stories tall with
the bottom floor as retail (I lived above an insurance agent and a
restaurant) and those above as residential. Many of the buildings are
fairly old and so have narrow staircases and a small, if existent,
elevator. Day-to-day, this isn't too bad, but when you go to move in or
out, the stairs turn into a nightmare. So the solution is to bring your
own "moving elevator" on moving day! Such a moving elevator can be
carried nicely on a trailer behind the moving truck and unfolds at your
soon-to-be-former lodging. Point it at a window, which can be as large
as your front door and is never screened, and the moving begins!\
