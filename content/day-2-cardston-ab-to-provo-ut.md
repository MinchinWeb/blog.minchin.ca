*Monday, April 27, 2009*

The goal today is Provo, Utah, which is a pretty good drive (probably
11-12 hours), but there really isn’t much I want to see in between, and
besides I have an appointment tomorrow in Provo.

I woke up in the morning to a surprise – I thought I had driven out of
the snow, but it had caught up to me during the night. I went outside to
find 4 inches of heavy wet snow that promises to make the roads
miserable. I was going to take the backroads south from Cardston and cut
through Cut Bank, Montana to the I-15, but with the roads in the shape
they were (and likely unplowed) I decided it was best to head north
before going south and thus stay on the main roads, which would add an
hour to my trip. Listening to the radio, I discovered that there was
much more snow to come – they were forecasting 12-18 inches of snow on
the plains of Montana, and 3 feet of snow in the mountains, and had a
winter storm warning in effect until next Thursday! Heading south, the
snow finally ran out just after Conrad, I got a little rain near
Jefferson Falls, and finally a little sunny sky at Helena. One of the
funny things about this trip too was as I drove south, even as it got
later in the day, the temperature kept rising; when I left Cardston, it
was just under zero, and by the time I got to Provo, it was 14C. After a
long day’s drive, I finally made it to Provo just before midnight.
