Speaking French, one of the things I have to pay particular attention to
are *faux amis* -- literally *false friends*. These are French words that
sound like an English word, but don't mean the same thing as the English
word in question. In general, their existence just makes me pay more
attention to French words and their meanings. And then sometimes you
come across a 'fake-English' word used in such a way to be hilarious.
This is one of those times. This photo was taken on a bus in St. Malo --
"Obliterate Your Tickets Please!"
