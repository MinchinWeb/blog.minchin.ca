*Friday, May 8, 2009*

Today is the home stretch – the plan is to make it to Montreal and meet
up with friends there tonight for dinner. I do wish I was another 2+
hours closer though...

To start the day, I filled up with gas, and found the dance troop from
the same school I looked into studying at in Utah there too – I guess
they are doing a tour of the north eastern United States. When I got on
the road in into New York, I started seeing signs for Tim Horton’s at
the rest stops, and so the first chance I got, I pulled in to get a
doughnut and a reminder of home. I stopped in at Palmyra to check out
the Hill Cumorah and surrounded sights. I ended up staying for about two
hours (two hours I didn’t really have...) and eating lunch there, and
they off to Montreal! At this point Montreal is about 500km away but I
have only 4 and half hours to meet my friends. I should mention that the
Interstate through New York is VERY well patrolled, which cops what
seems to be every 10 miles. That, combined with the 65 MPH speed limit,
and you can understand that the attitudes towards roads in this part of
the world is very different than that of, say, Texas or California. I
crossed into Canada at the 1000 Islands bridge, and then pulled up to
the dorms at the University of Montreal dorms just before 10 to bring
this crazy road trip to an end. Now for the business of living in
Quebec....
