I went rambling through the bushes and brought home a visitor that I
quickly dispatched. But first, he turned into my photo subject. As a
photo subject, a bug of this size is incredibly hard to shoot -- the
distance between in and out of focus is a matter of millimetres. Some of
my other bug pictures haven't turned out because I can't hold still
enough! It doesn't help either that it is near impossible to tell on the
camera screen whether something this small is in focus either. But I
have a winner here!
