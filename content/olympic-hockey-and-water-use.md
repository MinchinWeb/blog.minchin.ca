This was too priceless to pass up....

A little over a week ago the Olympics in Vancouver came to a finish,
which concluded with the Men’s Hockey final between Canada and the
United States. It promised to be epic, and it delivered. Being away from
home, I had the ‘pleasure’ of pulling out my big Canadian flag and
watching the game with some American friends, although I did wish from
time to time that it was a Canadian network (instead of NBC) so that the
commentary on the game would have been better. But I digress, it was an
epic game, and an epic finish indeed with Sidney Crosby scored the
game-winning goal for Canada seven minutes into overtime.

Reports since have claimed that it was the biggest event in Canadian
sporting history, with 80% of the population tuning in at one point or
another. To illustrate the effect of this, EPCOR (the water utility in
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) release a graph showing the city’s water
demand while the game was on. It’s amazing to watch the swings between
when the game picks up and the end of the periods.

But like I said, amazing game. GO CANADA!

usage on a 'normal' day)
