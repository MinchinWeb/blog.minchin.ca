After everyone else goes to bed, the world remains interesting and alive. This
is a small farming community, not far from home. I love how the lights from the
village are set against the light still in the Western sky, coming over the
mountains.

Taking pictures are night is proving a little difficult, and among the biggest
challenges is getting the photos to focus right. I wonder if they still make
split prisms... (example: [out of
