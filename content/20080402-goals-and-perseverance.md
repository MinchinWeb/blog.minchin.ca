I came across I quote this week that really got me thinking.

> When in situations of stress, we wonder if there is any more in us to

> perfectly placed us here to succeed. No one was foreordained to failâ€¦
> When we have been weighted and found wanting, let us remember that we
> were measured before and found equal to our tasks.

I've recently spent a fair bit of effort trying to put my life in its
proper order after going through what one friend termed as a "burnout"
at the beginning of the year. As I've thought about it, I realized that
I'd set out to do several hard things, but I do it because I know the
payoff at the end will make the effort worthwhile and I have the
confidence that I can accomplish what I set out to do. I also realized
that what I did accomplish, even during these crazy times, were the
things I had earlier established a goal to accomplish. Therefore, I hope
that through whatever may lie ahead, by declaring goals now, I will have
the strength to pull through, and accomplish my goals too. In no
particular order, my goals include:

-   Maintaining my **spirituality** -- spiritual thing have always served
    as an important touchstone in my life
-   Pursue my **education** and get my professional status in the next
    five years - education opens the door to opportunity
-   Buy **my own place**, soon after graduation
-   Give my **love life** that attention it deserves
-   Have **a building named after me**

Did I miss anything? I'd be interested to hear how you've dealt with
burnout in your life.

*En Advance!*
