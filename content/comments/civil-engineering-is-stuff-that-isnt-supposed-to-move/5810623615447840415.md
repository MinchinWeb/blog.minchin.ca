Quit making excuses for Civil Engineers. Bully for you that you trust them, but
there have been too many reports of problems with bridges & buck passing in the
past ten years or so to say these are random incidents. If bridges were
designed properly they would not collapse. Maybe its about time the engineers
who design these things were held accountable & tried in a court of law.
