Unfortunately, as you point out, the interstate (and Canada's Highway system) has provided the backbone to the north American way of life.<BR/><BR/>Solving the problems inherent in the interstate system requires not just a profound shift in our perception, but a radical revolution of the American (and Canadian) way of life.  There is, as always, huge resistance to this.<BR/><BR/>I am excited about a high-speed link between Edmonton and Calgary for example (and I can't think of a better place for a transportation revolution to happen).  However, with this must come a significant improvement to public transportation in both cities; you cannot do a job half-way and expect to get results.
