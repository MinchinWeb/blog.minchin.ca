Agreed, Nathan.<BR/><BR/>One advantage here in Canada is we don't seem to have developed the same problem of "Freeway Suburbs"; here the freeways seem to be built after the suburbs exist (I'm thinking of the Sherwood Park Freeway in Edmonton, or the Trans-Canada going into Vancouver). But the transition of mindset is just as grand on either side of the border.<BR/><BR/>I too am excited to see a high-speed rail link between Edmonton and Calgary, although I wonder when anyone will step up to the plate to champion the project and make it a reality. I think it would be a huge economic boom to both cities. I think of Reims in France, where house prices doubled or more between when the high-speed rail to Paris was announced and when it was opened.<BR/><BR/>Any thoughts when we might see such a project go forward?
