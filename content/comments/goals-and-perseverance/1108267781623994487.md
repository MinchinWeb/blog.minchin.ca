When I was where you were, I had the exact same goals.  They have now changed:<BR/><BR/>Spirituality is still #1, Develop professionally is still up there.  But I've seen now that buying my own place is not a priority, because I realise that until I've developed proffessionally, and/or gotten married, I'm not actually settled.<BR/><BR/>What I've moved up on the list, in having experienced burnout, and am now using that experience to avoid another, is to maintain balance.  Never let any one goal consume the others, or you will fail at all of them.
