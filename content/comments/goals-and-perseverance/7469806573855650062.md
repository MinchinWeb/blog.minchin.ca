What n. forsyth said is very wise:  "Never let any one goal consume the others, or you will fail at all of them."  - However in talking about spirituality, remember that your relationship with God is a great thing that changes everything else you will ever do for the better.<BR/><BR/>Something I have found most helpful is first writing down my values and priorities and numbering them in importance and then writing out my goals and making sure they are in line with my priorities.  Then I number the goals in importance.  That keeps things in proper perspective for me.<BR/><BR/>Good luck with everything you do!
