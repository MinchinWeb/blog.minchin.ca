PS.  A lot of that traffic that you're wondering about is all headed to and
from California.  I think you'd be amazed at how much of the population of
California travels up North to Utah (but then again a lot of it stops in
Nevada), but there's constant traffic.  Look at the plates...lots are Cali
plates I bet.
