Just a note.  It's named zzyxz for a reason.  You know how you place the name game in the car?  You look for the letter 'A' in a sign somewhere, then the letter 'B', etc. etc. etc.  Or you play the double letters game in the car instead.  This would cover both games as you're coming to Utah.  I believe it was intentionally named that way specifically for that reason.  I need to check my references though and get back to you on that.
