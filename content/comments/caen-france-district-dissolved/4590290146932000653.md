I helped teach Joel Fournier as a missionary way back in 1976.  I was also serving in Versailles at the time the Paris Stake was organized.  It was an exciting time.   My mission assignments were in Colombes, Morsang-sur-Orge, Melun, Versailles, Rouen, and Nantes.  As a 60 year old, I still get excited thinking of those times.  God bless...Que Dieu te-benisse.
