Hey there !<br /><br />Just found your blog out of the facebook Paris mission page.<br />My name is Thomas Fournier and I currently serve in the Paris stake high concil.<br />To give you answers, the branches of Coutances and Cherbourg have been put directly under the mission&#39;s authority, just as you thought.<br />Of course, all these changes are temporary, and there is a bigger picture to this : the creation of a third stake in the extended Paris area, in about 4 to 5 years from now. This project is not only our current stake presidency&#39;s view, but also the view of the area pdcy, as well as the 1st pdcy...<br /><br />According to Pdt Kimball&#39;s prophecy given in Paris in 1978, France will be filled with stakes and there will be a temple one day, &quot;maybe more&quot;.<br />This prophecy is being fulfilled today.<br />Until last June, there was only 2 districts in France. Now only the Brest district remains, probably not for long. Besides, the temple has never been so close, as the church has been authorized to purchase the site.<br /><br />Fresh news : the branch of Mantes has just been converted into a ward this very past Sunday (Dec 3, 2011).<br /><br />Just thought these few words might be helpful to you guys...<br />If you want more details, don&#39;t hesitate to contact me !
