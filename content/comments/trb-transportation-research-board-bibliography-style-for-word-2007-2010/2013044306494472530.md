The basic problem is you need to move your citations from Zotero to Word&#39;s
database. Once that&#39;s accomplished, you can apply my style. If you get this
far, you may still need to recreate the inline references [(3), etc.] in Word
again. A pain, but possible...

I&#39;ve never used Zotero, so I am unable to test this myself, but it seems
that (based on what I read online) that Zotero allows you to export your
citations. If you can export as an XML file, try importing that file directly
into Word. If that&#39;s not possible, export the file in the EndNote formate
(you should get an RIS file) and then import that into Word using <a

Manager</a>, and add-in for Word, to import your RIS file.

Hopefully that helps. Let me know how it works out!
