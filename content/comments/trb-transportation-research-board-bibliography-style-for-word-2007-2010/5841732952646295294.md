this is not quite working for me.<br />i downlaoded the file, then i put it in the Bibliography folder under program files, microsoft office, office 12, 1033 (there was no style folder).  the style did not show up when i reopened word... so i went back and created a style folder under bibliography.  at this point, all the referencing features stopped working (the menu commandes showed as grey so they could not be clicked... any ideas??? TRB deadline is in 2 days!!!!
