Great to see the interest. :)

For me the folder is: \ `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12\Bibliography\Style`

(I&#39;m running Windows 7 &amp; Office 2007)

You&#39;ll know you have the right one because there should be a list of the
other styles that come with Word (APA.XLS, CHICAGO.XSL, MLA.XLS, etc). The
&#39;Styles&#39; folder should already exist!

Best of luck, let me know if it&#39;s still not working...
