Great to see the interest. :)<br /><br />For me the folder is:  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12\Bibliography\Style`<br /><br />(I&#39;m running Windows 7 &amp; Office 2007)<br /><br />You&#39;ll know you have the right one because there should be a list of the other styles that come with Word (APA.XLS, CHICAGO.XSL, MLA.XLS, etc). The &#39;Styles&#39; folder should already exist!<br /><br />Best of luck, let me know if it&#39;s still not working...
