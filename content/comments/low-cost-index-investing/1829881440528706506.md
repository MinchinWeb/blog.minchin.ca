Just the brokerage fees, which you pay to both buy and sell. At a discount brokerage (i.e. most online ones), this is a flat fee of $7-20. A big reason why I choose these ETF&#39;s through iTRADE is I can buy and sell them for free (with one condition: I hold them for at least a day).

So what I have set up involves no purchase or selling fees. :)
