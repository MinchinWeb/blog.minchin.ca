Mutual funds usually have a fee, maybe up to 5% to purchase. This might be front end meaning you pay it when you purchase the fund, or back end meaning you pay it when you sell the fund. The back end usually reduces over time so if you hold onto the fund for several years it reduces to zero.  Do the EFT&#39;s have similar fees?
