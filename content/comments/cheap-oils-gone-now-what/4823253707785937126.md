Interesting thoughts Will.  I've always wondered whether or not moving closer to the University would be a good idea and whether it would save me money.  You run into the problem of rent by the U is typically higher than off campus and becomes a convenience vs. price battle.  While the University is closer to the hub of things, I don't live extremely further away either and so is harder for me to judge.<BR/><BR/>Although new technologies emerge, I think it will still be slow to market.  Increasing demand for products such as hybrid vehicles and all electric vehicles will push these markets along, however I think it will still take a fairly long time.  The demand on oil products are rapidly increasing with greater and greater force especially with places like India and China starting to develop rapidly especially in various rural areas in regions of those countries.
