I don't think that it is very useful to package such a simple plugin for
pypi. In my case, I just have to download the Python files with wget,
place them in a folder called summary inside the plugin's folder and
change the pelicanconf.py file. Anyway, it's great that you've done that
for people who prefer using pip.

You can use the `test_summary.py` script from the [original summary
plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/summary),
so I don't see why you cannot use that for the tests.

PD. It's a shame that the comment system doesn't work without JavaScript.
