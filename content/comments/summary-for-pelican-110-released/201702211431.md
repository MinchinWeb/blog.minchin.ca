Jorge, I agree, it does sometimes seem a little overkill to me to package such a simple package as this and post in on PyPI; perhaps that's the reason it hasn't been done before now. However there are two big reasons I've packaged these plugins up:

1. `wget` isn't available, by default, on Windows, but if you've managed to get Python installed, `pip` is; and
2. `pip` allows for better, easier repeatability in installing. This is important because I'm working to automate the build process for my blog.

It turns out the original test suite was copied over with the rest of the code, and the tests there still pass. I've updated the article accordingly. Thanks for pointing me in that direction!

As for the comment system, I should figure out what better to display if JavaScript is disabled....
