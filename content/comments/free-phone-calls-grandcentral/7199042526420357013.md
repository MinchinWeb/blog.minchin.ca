It's too bad about the sound quality.  I can think of a couple instances where this would come in handy.  The only other hindrance is that you're not always near a computer.  This would work well as a house phone as you can by by one in the house, but contacting you on your cell with poor quality will hinder people's use of this program especially in the States where calls are frequently made using cell phones.
