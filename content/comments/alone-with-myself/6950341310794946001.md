I, by nature, tend not to keep to myself during the day, but more so at night.
I enjoy being out in the public, but have learned to love my privacy as well.
My thoughts and feelings are important to me and precious.

Emotions and thoughts are also two different parts of me, and it is hard to
separate the two.  One is rational, the other is not as you have stated above.
I'm not convinced that anyone can master their emotions, and is quite difficult
to even the most rational of people.  To master your emotions and harness them
in such a manner I believe would take a part of your emotions and would dampen
a sense of human feelings that is so vital to our existence.

Can you imagine if we didn't have a sense of horror when we see violence,
sadness when we see something wrong being done?  To be able to harness the
emotion of love during a happy time in your life or grief when something sad,
such as a loved one passing away?

Emotions give us strength in many ways that we don't expect, and can make us
vulnerable and weak in other ways.  However, it is important to experience all
types of emotions and sometimes we need to learn to wait out the rain.  That is
sometimes the hardest part.
