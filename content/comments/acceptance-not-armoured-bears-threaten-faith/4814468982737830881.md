Hey Minchin.<BR/><BR/>I appreciate the well-thought-out response. I could argue your opinion that my editorial was "simplistic," but you're surely entitled to your opinion of my work. I do, however, wholly admit it was one-sided, as it was intended to be.<BR/><BR/>I think you raise a valid point that dialog and tolerance of religion is important to society, and I completely agree. What I meant by religion being a personal endeavour is that other people's opinions should not serve to shake your faith. And, on the other side, you should not feel compelled to thrust your faith upon other people because you believe it to be law.<BR/><BR/>If a group of people want to openly discuss religion, that's fine. But the discussion of religion is not necessarily the practice of it. Two atheists could have a discussion of the pros and cons of Islam. They are having an open dialog and, hopefully, showing tolerance towards the topic, but neither are practicing any form of religion.<BR/><BR/>The actual practice is what I believe should be a private endeavour. If it were, I think we would have significantly less flare ups like the ones over <I>The Golden Compass</I>.<BR/><BR/>Again, thanks for a really intelligent and well thought out response. It's nice to know that there are readers that think very critically of our content.<BR/><BR/>Cheers,<BR/>Ryan Heise<BR/>Deputy News Editor :: The Gateway.
