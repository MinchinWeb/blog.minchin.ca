I've read the *His Dark Materials* trilogy and thought it was interesting.  I
had to ask myself what is the difference in what I believe, and what the Author
appears to think religious people believe.

I can understand how Mr. Pullman would feel that religion is oppressive, but i
firmly disagree.  I also feel that if Mr. Pullman could see things from my
point of view, he might be more respectful towards what myself and others hold
sacred, even if he might not hold them sacred himself.

The danger I think is in taking our own point of view for granted.  When we
feel that our way of looking at thinks is the only rational way, we people we
disagree with as stupid or irrational.  This miscomprehension does more to
divide humanity than anything else.

Understanding why others feel/think/act the way they do does not mean that you
have to abandon your own views. What it does require is confidence in your
convictions and a sincere respect for other people.  We must refuse to feel
threatened by people we feel are disrespectful.

So Armored Bears are not the problem. It is the failure to understand, the
failure to communicate that threatens faith and peace.
