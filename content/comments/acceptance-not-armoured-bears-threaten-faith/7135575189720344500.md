I've read the <I>His Dark Materials</I> trilogy and thought it was interesting.  I had to ask myself what is the difference in what I beleive, and what the Author appears to think religious people believe.<BR/><BR/>I can understand how Mr. Pullman would feel that religion is oppressive, but i firmly disagree.  I also feel that if Mr. Pullman could see things from my point of veiw, he might be more respectful towards what myself and others hold sacred, even if he might not hold them sacred himself.<BR/><BR/>The danger I think is in taking our own point of veiw for granted.  When we feel that our way of looking at thinks is the only rational way, we people we disagree with as stupid or irrational.  This miscomprehension does more to divide humanity than anything else.<BR/><BR/>Understanding why others feel/think/act the way they do does not mean that you have to abandon your own veiws.  What it does require is confidence in your convictions and a sincere respect for other people.  We must refuse to feel threatened by people we feel are disrespectful.  <BR/><BR/>So Armored Bears are not the problem.  It is the failure to understand, the failure to communicate that threatens faith and peace.
