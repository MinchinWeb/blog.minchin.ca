I would say that if can find a cheap trip to Paris, it may be cheaper than flying to Montreal unless you can find a cheap flight there (hard to do).  There's good things to do in both and I'm sure unique things to both, but I believe most people dream of going to Europe more than across Canada, but I could be wrong.
