Maybe people are looking for a scapegoat, but AIG plays a significant role with
the banks for as to what the economy is doing right now.  I think people feel
more so that it is unfair that government is getting involved and bailing out
the big companies out of messes that they created on their own.  If I were to
go out and make a mistakes and declare myself bankrupt, it would take the
better portion of 10 years to dig myself out of the hole and banks are fairly
unforgiving for declaring bankruptcy.  Lawmakers will definitely have a
difficult time convincing the public that AIG was not given a free ride, and
many are convinced that the government should stay out of it.
