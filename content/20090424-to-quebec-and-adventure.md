At this moment, my life is full of excitement, and the good kind too!
Last week I finished up exams and am now done my degree, and I have a
grand adventure lined up for the summer -- a working exchange in Québec.

To graduate is a weird time in life, because it is a very definite mark
between one chapter in life and the next. At times like this, I tend to
turn reflective, and contemplative of the path that has brought me here.
I had a free afternoon the other day and so decided to stop in on my old
high school. It was fun to catch up to my old teachers, who, in contrast
with many of my university professors, actually had the chance to get to
know me, and so thus, years later, still remember me. Looking forward is
weird -- sometimes in the midst of school it's hard to imagine it will
ever end, but here I am! Now to plan the future, and the world really
does seem to be my oyster. I have the summer mostly figured out, but
from there, the options are endless.

Québec will be a blast. I'm driving out there, so I'll have my car, and
I plan to go adventuring -- I figure everything within 4-6 hours is fair
game for a weekend trip, which includes Ottawa, Montréal, Québec City,
and even Boston. It will also give me a chance keep up my French, and I
think it will be fun to get out of town and see some Canadian history.
Plus, it works much better to go to either Paris (rather expensive) or
Tunsia (what can I do but be a tourist?), two of the other places I was
considering going for a bit following graduation.

The drive out there will be an adventure in and of itself. I have two
weeks, so I'm going to take the scenic route -- via southern California
and New York City. Thanks to the wonders of Google, below is a copy of
my (tentative) route and some of the places I might visit if time and
desire permit. If I can find internet, I'll try and keep you updated
here as I go along.

Well, I'm off to the adventure called life!
