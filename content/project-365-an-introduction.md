Project 365 is an idea I’ve seen tossing around online various places
and decided to give it a try. The basic premise is to take a picture
every day for a year.  I started on July 9th and today is the 26th, so I
have 10 photos in 18 days… hmmm. But I’ll do better – school has cooled
off and I feel like I’ve gotten a better hang of what this project is
going to require in terms of dedication.

</p>
The point, first and foremost is to have fun. Photography is something
that I’ve enjoyed since high school, but not something I’ve always been
able to enjoy regularly. I hope that just the sheer time and practice of
taking photos will make me better at it. If nothing else, the trial and
error will show me what works and what simply doesn’t. Putting the
photos online is a way to make this project a little more social. If you
have comments, suggestions on how to improve my photos, suggested shots,
offers of equipment, or want to pose as a model, please let me know!

</p>
Photography is about ‘light writing’; that is what the Greek roots of
the word mean. The camera sees the world different that I do with my
eyes. At first, that is a limitation, but as I’ve come to understand the
way the camera ‘sees’ the world, I can use this for artistic purposes.
Effects such as limited depth of field, motion blur, camera flare, and
frozen waterfalls are all a result of the camera ‘seeing’ the world
different than you and I.

</p>
As well, photography is about moments in time. Videos show time
unfolding and even paintings, though static, are not tied to a specific
time. Photography is about the moment, right NOW. A second earlier or
later, and the photo is different.

</p>
All together, I’m sure that I will start to see the world differently. I
look forward to the results, documenting both my world, and perhaps more
importantly, myself.

</p>
Thank you for joining me. I hope we enjoy the trip!
