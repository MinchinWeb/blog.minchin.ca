*Monday, May 4, 2009*

I got into El Paso ridiculously late last night, and then with the new
time zone, it was almost 2:30 in the morning when I made it to bed. The
late night means that it's only now (at 11 o'clock the next morning)
that I'm finishing breakfast. The task before me is a little daunting --
I have 3,900 km between me and Montreal, and 5 days to cover it if I
want to meet the kids flying in. The goal for today is Dallas area,
where I have lined up to stay with the friend of a friend.

If I had more time, White Sands, New Mexico is recommended, especially
at sunset, and the Carsbad Caverns, also in New Mexico, which are one of
the largest cave systems in North America and are supposed to be
spectacular. However, visiting the two would add another day, a day
which I don't really have at this point.

They say everything is bigger in Texas, and perhaps it's true. The
expanse certainly gives new meaning to "wide, open spaces." Texas itself
is huge -- if you drive I-10 from one end of the state to the other, it's
almost 900 miles (by way of comparison, Alberta is just shy of 1000
miles, north to south). Even the sky seems bigger, with the clouds more
aloof.

I'm not sure where I'm headed tomorrow, beyond getting my oil changed
and seeing Minchin, Texas, which is probably about half an hour from
where I'm staying, and then I should head north and east. New Orleans
would be great, but I think it's a little too far from where I need to
go, although Ottawa and Palymra remain options.
