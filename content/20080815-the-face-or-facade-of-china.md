So the item all over the news of late is the Olympics, which are being
held as we speak in Beijing, and will go on for the next week or so.
Giving the games to China has been the source of controversy since the
decision was made in 2001 - while China suggested it was the chance to
show itself off as an emerging world player, the critics argued that
China's record, particularly on human rights, made it an inappropriate
host.

But that battle is over - China got the Games, Let the Games Begin! -
and the questions and critics now focus on the actual execution of the
Olympic production, years in the making. It hasn't taken long for the
critics to find their talking points. [Issues that have come
up](http://www.athlists.com/?p=36) (as of the 13th, 5 days into the 16
day production) include:

-   **Internet Access & the Free Press** -- While the Press feels they
    were promised free access to the internet, several sites appear to
    be blocked; the Chinese feel they are delivering what they promised.
    The Press was also was promised freedom to report as they normally
    would, however there have been reports of visa problems, travel
    restrictions, police intimidation, limited access to venues,
    particularly to Tienanmen Square, and instructions not to air live
    interviews. (read [the New York Times'
    comments](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/21/sports/olympics/21nbc.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin)
    on the matter)
-   **Fireworks** -- To execute a flawless Opening Ceremonies, many of
    the fireworks shown to the TV audience were actually computer
    generated and added to the scene. The claim was it would be too
    difficult to film from a helicopter in real time.
-   **Ode to the Homeland** -- This patriotic song was also part of the
    Opening Ceremonies -- but the trick was there was two girls
    involved - 9 year old Lin Miaoke on stage, lip-syncing to the
    pre-recorded voice of 7 year old Yang Peiyi. The official line is
    that it was a casting choice; the critics claim it went too far.
    ([CBC's
    coverage](http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2008/08/12/olympics-lipsynch.html?ref=rss))
-   **No Citizen Protests** -- The central government promised to allow
    citizens to protest during the Games, but they are restricted to
    three public parks, and must apply at least four days in advance. So
    far, [no citizens have showed
    up](http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/13/asia/protest.php), but
    rumours of those attempting to apply being intimated or arrested
    have.
-   **How Old Are the Gymnasts** -- To be young is an advantage in
    Gymnastics, but there is a rule that you must be at least 16 to
    compete at the Olympics. China claims all members of its team meet
    that standard, but [reporters have cast doubt on the exact ages of
    three
    competitors](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1832312,00.html?imw=Y)
    (of the six that compete together for the team event), and there's
    only the word of the Chinese government, in the form of
    government-issued passports, in support of their ages. To add
    intrigue, Yang Yun, a member of the Chinese Gymnastics team at the
    2000 Olympics in Sydney, admitted to being 14 when she competed
    there.
-   **Beijing Weather** -- The air quality in Beijing is often among the
    worst in the world, enough so that the possibility of canceling
    endurance events persists. While Beijing claims to have improved air
    quality, [an independent scientist has released a report suggesting
    the numbers have been
    fudged](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1722450,00.html)
    by selectively choosing sampling sites and times.
-   **All Sold Out?** -- The Games' organizers claim that every event was
    sold out, but reporters on the ground report seeing [blocks of
    identically dressed Chinese
    spectators](http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/beijing/blog/fourth_place_medal/post/Volunteer-fans-fill-the-stands-in-Beijing?urn=oly,100302),
    and speculate that they are bussed-in 'cheerleaders' to make the
    venues seems full.

Is the internet access issue a misunderstood or a broken promise? - the
head of the IOC has French as his native tongue, not English, and thus
some have suggested that journalists have misunderstood him by taking
the literal meaning of his English words. Did we miss something in
translation on the other points, or have the Chinese straight up lied to
us? To me, it increasingly looks like China has become all about
posturing at the Games - a facade without substance. The history that
this all reminds me of is the Russians during the Cold War; after the
USSR fell, we, in the West, discovered the appearance of military might
had come at the cost of all else.

And so I wonder, Is it deception, in the goal of flawless execution, or
is it simple cultural misunderstanding? China wanted to play with the
"Big Boys," and wanted the Olympics to prove it had the wherewithal to
do so. Thus, right or wrong, the Chinese actions will be judged in the
West by the values of the West, and honesty is still valued more than
showmanship here.
