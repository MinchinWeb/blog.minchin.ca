These crumbling steps were once the front door to a splendid building,
dreamed up as a vacation resort for the working class. Things didn't
quite work out that way, with the building used as a hospital during the
First World War and being blown up during the Second. Now, only the
stairs remain as a lonely testiment to that dream.
