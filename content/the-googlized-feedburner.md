In case you took a weekend away from the computer, which I apparently
didn’t, Google has just bought out
[Feedburner](http://minchinweb.blogspot.com/2007/04/feedburner-fun.html).
I'm not sure what this will mean for me, although they have promised to
keep the service up and running. I imagine there will be some
re-branding, and I'm hoping for better integration with my other Google
services, like Blogger, Analytics, and AdSense. I'll keep my eyes open,
and let you know if something really crazy happens.
