These last couple weeks have been really busy - I have a couple of very
important papers due that I'm trying to get done on a tight schedule,
along with everything else in life - and at times in feels overwhelming.
I have been grateful to have Elder Maxwell's encouraging words,
originally recorded in my Journal, to bring to mind. Perhaps it's a
mindset, a belief, but it gives me great comfort to know that whatever
my tasks are today, they are not insurmountable! Success can, and will
be, mine! And so I plug a little more on my papers, finish the day with
a smile, and will be back at it tomorrow.

You can also read Elder Maxwell's full talk, entitled ["A More
Determined
Discipleship"](http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?locale=0&sourceId=1846d0640b96b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD),
which he gave as a devotional at Brigham Young University in 1978.
Discipleship was a theme in much of Elder Maxwell's teaching, but he
lived the words he taught. Highly recommended!
