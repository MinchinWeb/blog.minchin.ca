I enjoy tinkering, but due to time constraints and what I have laying
around, most of my tinkering involves either my
[website](http://www.minchin.ca/index.htm) or my computer. However, the
other day I read about how to [turn a TI-83 into an
intervalometer](http://www.instructables.com/id/Turn-a-TI-Graphing-Calculator-into-an-Intervalomet/),
connect it to a a camera, let it take pictures for a while, and then
turn the stream of photos in a time lapse movie. Well, I had both the
calculator and a camera at home, so I was off to the races! Check out my
finished result - I'm pretty impressed with how it turned out.

For reference, the pictures were taken approximately every 35 seconds (I
put "10000" into the program on the Ti-83Plus) for about 100 minutes (my
camera battery died...) and then put together in Windows Movie Maker
with the pictures displayed at 8fps. For those of those of you doing the
math, that's like pushing fast forward and having it run at about 280x!
