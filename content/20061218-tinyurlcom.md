Back when the internet started and you wanted to find something, websites had
simple names. As more and more people have moved onto the internet, most of the
simple names were snapped up and now sell for a small fortune. Adding to the
confusion is that is that many websites will pass information back to their
server using what appears to be random gibberish to the rest of us (check out
the URL next time you do a search at Google or the like). Someone got smart and
came up with a solution! Enter [tinyurl.com](http://tinyurl.com/). Enter your
long, convoluted URL in and they spit out a much shorter. For example, start
with [MinchinWeb.BlogSpot.com](http://minchinweb.blogspot.com) and end up with
[tinyURL.com/y6xxef](http://tinyurl.com/y6xxef), which granted isn't a ton
shorter, but it shows up a lot better is we go with something longer, like
[http:// minchinweb.blogspot.com/ 2006/12/
tinyurlcom-on-line-wonders-iii.html](http://minchinweb.blogspot.com/2006/12/tinyurlcom-on-line-wonders-iii.html),
the perment link for this post, and you get
[tinyURL.com/y3lvrh](http://tinyurl.com/y3lvrh). Not so shabby! Give it a try
for yourself:

<form action="http://tinyurl.com/create.php" method="post" target="_blank" markdown=1>
**Enter a long URL to make [tiny](http://tinyurl.com):**

<input type="text" name="url" size="30"><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Make TinyURL!"> 
</form>
