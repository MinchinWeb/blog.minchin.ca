I have to admit I'm a bit of a fan of Google's services, and tend to pay
a fair bit of attention when Google decides to pick up a company - to
me, founded or not, it signals that the service will stick around and
has the financial backing to continue offering a good service on the
cheap.

## GrandCentral - What it is

Take the example of [GrandCentral](http://www.grandcentral.com). The
site was established by Craig Walker & Vincent Paquet with the goal of
creating one number that would never change that you could be reached at
any time (no more having to tell people when you're in the office, when
you're on your cell, etc). It does that by assigning you a new phone
number, and then you set up forwarding rules to forward your calls to
another phone. The other thing it allows you to do is call out using
their webpage - select your phone and who you want to call and it will
ring your phone and then ring up your friend.

## Why I Love It

I have a number of friends living in the United States and calling south
of the boarder can quickly become expensive. I set up my GrandCentral
number so that my friends could call me (most of them have free
States-wide long distance on their cell phones) and I could it turn call
them. Incoming calls will always be free and outgoing calls remain free
during the beta period, according to their website. It's totally free
for me, because I have free incoming calls on my cell phone. That's what
I set it up for, and it works great for that.

There's other cool features too:

-   **A "Web Call" button**: Put a little bit of code on the web and
    anyone can call you, without even giving out your phone number. It's
    supposed to be great for blogs or eBay listings or the like.
-   **Call Screening**: You never have to worry about getting unwanted
    calls. When someone call you, after you pick up, you're given the
    option of 1) accepting the call, 2) sending the call to voicemail,
    3) send to voicemail, but listen in (like we used to do with the
    answering machine at home), or 4) record the call. On the website,
    you can set up forwarding rules, including sending certain callers
    to a "This number is no longer available" message - great for
    telemarketers or ex-girlfriends that won't leave you alone.

There's a number of other options that let you do a number of really
cool things, but these are the few that I've found particularly useful.

## What I Wish It Had

For all the wonders of the service, there are still a few things I wish
the service had. My wishlist included:

-   **Better Sound Quality**: The sound quality varies, but is often
    sub-par. That being said, it's been worse when I'm on my cell phone
    and so is my friend - cell phones are exactly noted for sound
    quality.
-   **Canadian numbers**: Although GrandCentral will ring on a Canadian
    number, they offer no Canadian numbers to serve as your GrandCentral
    number. For me, this is a fairly big hindrance to using the service
    to as designed - my friends will send me an email or find out my
    cell number before making an international call to get a hold of me.
-   **To Call Without Internet Access**: I don't see a good solution to
    this, but as it sits right now, it order to call out, you need to go
    to GrandCentral's website. Most of the time, I'm close to a
    computer, but the great thing about a phone is it stands alone, and
    it doesn't if you have to rely on a website (I'm too cheap to pay
    for mobile internet on my cell phone). Maybe placing calls by
    sending a SMS would be a solution...

## Canadian Access

I know I've stated this above, but to recap: Although no Canadian
numbers are offered by GrandCentral, you can forward your calls to
Canadian numbers and make calls from Canadian numbers (for example, by
using the web button above), so the service isn't a complete write off
it you live north of the 49th!

## Summary

I signed up for the service because it was free, and it gave me an
American number, so for me it has worked very well. Due to the sound
quality issues, and having to place calls though the website to use my
GrandCentral number (and the lack of Canadian numbers), I'm not likely
to use the service for it's intended purpose - "One number for Life" -
anytime soon. For recreational uses, I highly recommend!
