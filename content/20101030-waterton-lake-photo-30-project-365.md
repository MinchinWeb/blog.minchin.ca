An easy hike starting across from the road to the Prince of Wales hotel
is Bear"s Hump. The view, as noted above, is magnificent!

This image is actually the result of several overlapping images that
have been stitched together. By holding the settings constant (focal
distance, f-stop, exposure, etc.), the combined image looks like it's
one shot.

Clicking on the above image will bring up a larger version of it!
