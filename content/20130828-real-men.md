> Men are loyal. Men are honest. Men respect and honor women. A man goes out
> and finds one woman, and he vows to protect and love her for the rest of his
> life. A man would never betray that vow. Even the weakest and most cowardly
> man -- if he is a man at all -- would die for the woman he loves....
>
> You don't have to be "cool" or athletic. You don't have to play guitar or fix
> cars. These are all fine things, but they don't define a man. A man is
> defined by how he treats women, by how he keeps his promises, and by how he
> protects and serves the ones he loves. That's what makes a man a man.
