I'm on a St. Malo roll, why stop now?

St. Malo is a wonderful little city, and one of my favorite places to
visit in France. This here is on the beach, during low-ish tide. Just
barely off the coast, there are several old military posts. This is the
path leading to the closest one. But a picture of a path like this is a
little more because it opens the question "Where does this path lead?"

Where would you like it to lead?
