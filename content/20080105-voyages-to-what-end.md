The holiday season is drawing to a close, and for many of us, that means
going back to familiar routines of school and work and life in general.
I have always enjoyed the break the Christmas season brings, and the
chance to catch up to friends and family, some of which I haven't seen
since the year previous. This year also brought the occasion to travel,
and so I went to California for a week. I had an absolutely amazing
time; I spent New Year's Eve wandering through the redwoods and walking
along the beach with a wonderful girl -- it was the stuff memories are
made of. But I discovered something more. As I visited the places, and
conversed with the locals, I came to understand something of the
differences between the two places -- California and home. Things that I
had rarely questioned were questioned, and I wondered the logic of some
of the things they took for granted.

As I flew home, I came to realize a reason why those who are well
travelled can offer more than great pictures and crazy stories. Travel,
and the places and people that the traveller is brought into contact
with, allows him to develop a broader view of the world; it allows him
to return to where he started and with the new understanding, he sees
what he started with and it has changed, because he has, not because it
has. Truly, he has returned to where he began, and only then really seen
his world for the first time.

Bon voyage!
