Allow me to indulge in a little self-aggrandization – I was in the paper
last Monday! I guess a reporter at the Edmonton Sun found a bill in her
pocket marked Where’s Willy.com, took a look at it, and found my contact
information on that website. A phone interview, a quick photo shoot, and
a day later, I found my picture in the paper!

Willy](http://blog.minchin.ca/2007/03/wheres-willy.html) a year ago, the
article on the Sun’s website ([“Money
Trackers”](http://edmontonsun.com/News/Canada/2008/07/07/6085566-sun.html)),
