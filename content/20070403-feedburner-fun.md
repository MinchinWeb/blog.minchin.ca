A service I've known about for a while that I finally decided to check
out is [FeedBurner](http://www.FeedBurner.com). It seems to be the ideal
set of tool for dealing with your RSS and Atom feeds from your site. For
those unfamiliar, RSS and Atom are a simple way for people to see if
your site has updated recently. Bloggers and news web sites are among
the most common users, but its use has spread a lot further than that.
You can either view the feeds through a desktop program, often your
email client, or through an online reader, like
[Google](http://reader.google.com) (that's what I use).

As a result of picking up FeedBurner, I'm going to make a number of
changes to my blog, although I suppose most will be under the hood.
These will include changing the automatic RSS feed to FeedBurner's,
adding a "subscribe" and ["subscribe by
email"](http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/emailverifySubmit?feedId=824735)
link on the side, as well as a counter will the number of subscribers
(which I fear for the moment is probably depressing low). One of the
cool things I can do is create an image that rolls over the last few
headlines - very cool, I think! (I like the banner size one, but it
throws off the alignment of the whole blog, so we'll go with the little
one)

Another thing you can do is check out my RSS feed online at FeedBurner's
site at
[feeds.feedburner.com/MinchinWeb](http://feeds.feedburner.com/MinchinWeb).
So yeah, that's my latest fun.

<!-- (I like the 468x60 banner most, which now
sits at the bottom of each page [that might yet change], so I can't have
an image in the post as it will mess up the formating of my blog, so
look down or click below to get the code)
