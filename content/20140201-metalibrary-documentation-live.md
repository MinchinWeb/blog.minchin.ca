Over the last four years, I've been working on an AI called WmDOT for
OpenTTD, a remake of the classic Transport Tycoon, a beloved game from
my childhood. To support WmDOT, I've built a library of support
functions. Over the last three days, I have written up documentation for
the included functions and the result can be seen live at my site at
<http://minchin.ca/openttd-metalibrary/> I'm excited to have it up. I
hope it will help others make use of my library.

Metalibrary is currently at version 6.
