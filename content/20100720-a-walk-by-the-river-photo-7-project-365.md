It was a Sunday afternoon and a walk down the beach with my Love sounded
wonderful. The only problem is we live a long way from the ocean, so we
decided to try the local lake. Turns out the lake shore is a State park
and they wanted $9 just to let us in. Well, we weren't feeling that rich
so we settled for a walk along the shady trail next to the river and
spend a lovely afternoon together!
