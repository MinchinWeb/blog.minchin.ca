In a word, **snow**.

I can't help but feel it telling that all of the self-driving car trials take
place in sunny places like LA and Phoenix. Snow, as I see it, creates two large
obstacles for self-driving cars: the snow can physically obscure the road, and
the snow (and ice) will differentially change the road surface friction.

## An Obscured Road Surface

Even if you've never had the pleasure to drive in snowy conditions, it seem is
easy to understand that as snow falls, it will cover the road surface and the
markings on it. If you self-driving car is using a camera to "stay between the
lines", they all of sudden need a different lane marker. Adding to this, human
drivers don't always drive in the official "lanes" when the snow falls; in the
extreme, drivers on rural roads will generate only three tire tracks,
effectively using the center one when driving both ways down the road, and then
pulling over to the side (out of the tire tracks altogether) to pass oncoming
traffic.

One of my most stressful personal drives I've ever done was when the snow
completely covered the road surface and the surrounding fields were
snow-covered and at the same height as the road. Without any previous tracks to
follow, I drove two hours in the dark (with headlights only) keep a 3 inch bump
in the snow off to my right that I knew was the taller grass at the
pavement edge. There was no place to turn off, no shoulder, and I was worried
that if I stopped in the driving lane in the middle of the continuing stop
storm, someone would come up from behind and crash into me before they saw me.
All to say, not an enjoyable drive, and a very hard situration to expect a
self-driving car to perform well in.

## An Icy Road Surface

Perhaps less obvious if you've never driven in winter conditions is how (snow
and) ice change the response of the road surface itself. In perhaps the
simplest to understand situations, a layer of ice on the road (like after
freezing rain) will make the road itself slick, and so more distance is needed
to accelerate, break, and change direction. But more typical is that the
changing patterns of sunlight (and shadow), applied road salt, blowing snow,
and the passing of vehicles will create a patchwork of more and less icy
patches. A few examples:

- bridges tend to ice over before the rest of the roadway as temperatures drop,
  as they lack the ground under them as a heat store.
- as vehicles wait at the stop line of traffic light for the light to turn
  green, the heat from the engines will melt the ice on the road under them. As
  a result, the road is much slicker right before the stopline than elsewhere.
  Thus, you can't count on stopping at the stop line, and instead slow down
  much before the intersection, and only do the last bit of breaking at the
  stop line.
- as vehicles drive down the road, they clear out snow under the tirepath, but
  build up the snow in ridges beyond these ruts. Thus, when the vehicle moves
  sideways, such as to change lanes, the car will meet more resistance outside
  the normal running ruts. In extreme cases, in front wheel drive vehicles and
  heavy, slushy snow, if you accelerate as you hit this ridge, the wheel in the
  ridge will be mostly held by the extra snow while the "free" wheel in the
  driving lane continues to accelerate, and the car will spin!
- in extreme cold siturations (i.e. -20&deg;C or colder), as the snow blows
  across the highway, it will be crushed under the wheels of the passing
  vehicles, causing it to momentarily thaw and then re-freeze. Thus, wind-blown
  sections of the highway can busy much icier than sheltered sections. And
  patches of roadside trees and brush will result in repeated changes between
  windblown and sheltered sections of road, as you drive down a road.

What most of these siturations have in common is the best way to deal with them
is to anticipate them, rather than waiting for feedback from the vehicle in the
middle of the situation.

## Conclusions

Much as it would be cool to see self-driving/robot cars, I think it's easy to
under-estimate the complexities of winter driving. I would love to "let the car
drive" and let it worry about winter conditions, but I'm not holding my breath.
