So I don't know who he uses for PR, but some guy in California figured
May 21 was the "end of the world." Amh, that was yesterday, for those
keeping track. But the PR guy deserves a raise because the story seems
to have hit all the major papers. Never mind that the same guy predicted
the end of the world in 1994....

Anyway, I thought I'd share; it made me laugh :)
