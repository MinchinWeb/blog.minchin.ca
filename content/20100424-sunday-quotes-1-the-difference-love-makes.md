I think there is wisdom in this. As we approach life, the things that
ultimately will have the greatest impact are those actions that make
someone feel loved greatly. At least that's the case for me - the
moments that I remember touching (and changing) me the most happened on
the background of knowing I was loved. So go love someone today!
