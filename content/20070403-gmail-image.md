Although Nexodyne continues to work well, I came across another site
that allows me to add the nifity envelope to the image, so I decided to
change my little "Email me" picture. The site gives you three options,
but the downside is you have to host the image yourself (Nexodyne would
host it for you) and it only works for GMail. If you have another email
provider, check out Nexodyne, but if you like the envelope and have a
Gmail account, get your own image
[here](http://gizmo967.mgs3.org/Gmail/)! (The only downside is figuring
out how to get a transparent background - Photoshop doesn't seem to like
me today)
