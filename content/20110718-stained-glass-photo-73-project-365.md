Catholic churches are everywhere in France. After seeing several dozen, I
started to feel like I'd seen most of what there was to see. And then I would
wander into some random church and discover another gem. In many of the
churches, the stained glass was exquisite. Sometimes I could read the story in
the windows and other times I just wondered who all the saints could be. This
is a window I quite liked; I enjoyed how it depicted Jesus Christ, the "Lamb of
God."
