This is a thought experiment, and perhaps a glimpse into the future. The
question I start with is, "What happens if self-driving cars become a reality?"
I note that first order effects (like, Now I can eat breakfast in the car
because I don't have to hold the steering wheel anymore) are the easiest to
see, and with each step out (Does my breakfast change? How does that effect egg
farmers?), the results get easier and easier to get wrong.

I also note that we may never see true self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are
starting to feel like flying cars, in that they are just around the corner, but
years later have yet to arrive.

## Baseline Assumptions

First, a few baseline assumptions in this scenario:

- "Self-driving" means cars can drive themselves without human control, either
  local or remote. Also, that they can drive in the full range of conditions
  and situations that prudent human drivers can (and do) today. So it's not
  going to take you off-roading, but snow on the highway or missing lane lines
  through a construction zone are not a problem.
- Cars are going to be electric powered. This will be driven by (among other
  things) the need to safely "refuel" the car without requiring a human
  on-site.
- People are going to continue to go to the same places (work, school,
  shopping, etc.) in roughly the same amount as today (at least in the beginning).
- These self-driving cars will be roughly comparable with the cost to current
  cars; i.e. anyone who can currently afford a car today would be able to
  afford a future self-driving car.
- Renting a self-driving car will be cheaper than getting a taxi today, as
  there is no human behind the wheel to pay.


## Rent vs Own

The question of whether we will rent or own these new cars has huge
implications for those who are proposing to own the rental fleets (like Uber),
but probably don't change the may of the outcomes below. I'm going to (mostly)
punt on the question. 

## Scenario 1: Driving the Kids to School

One of the first interesting scenarios is getting the kids to school. Today,
either Mom (or Dad) drives them, or they take a school bus, or they walk.
However, once you have a self-driving car, Mom doesn't need to do more than
buckle the kid into the car and sent it on its way. Also, as Mom is not longer
tied to dropping off the kids, the kids can now go to school further from home
or (Mom's) work; really any school within about an hour has become a candidate.
There is also one less thing to encourage sibling to attend the same school, as
they can each take their own car to their respective school.

**Guess 1**: There will develop a demand for "kid pods": small, self-driving
cars that are sized to carry a single child and his school backpack.

One question that arises is, What to do with the kid's cars while they're in
school? Do the elementary schools build a parking lot, like my high school had?
Do you send the cars home? Do you send them away to another off-site parking
lot, or on an all day drive?

**Guess 2**: Parking "kid pods" will quickly become a policy issue for school
boards.

## Scenario 2: Regular Commute

The most reliable of trips for most people are their trips to and from work.
Almost universally, it is from a one set location (home) to another (the
office) at predicable times.

I'm writing this in the shadow of Covid, and so Work From Home (WFH) has become
almost universal in certain industries. Time will tell whether WFH becomes a
norm or these past two years have been an aberration. But regardless, in-person
work is required in many sectors, and many WFH organizations are pushing for a
hybrid arrangement that would see workers returns to the office several days a
week. In short, I don't think that this Covid-era has killed the commute.
However, it has become part of the work conversation to discuss non-traditional
arraignments (like WFH, even for part of the week) or adjusted hours. Where
this intersects with self-driving cars, I expect many couples would request
hours offset from each other so they could use the same car to commute, one
after the other, and I suspect bosses have become increasingly open to
considering this.

As well, if you are commuting in a rental car (rather than one you own), I
expect that the further you get from the traditional 8 to 5 start and end
times, the cheaper the rental rates will be (due to lower demand).

**Guess 3**: Bosses will get more requests for slightly offset start and end
times, to arraign commuting.

Like with kids delivered to school by self-driving cars, a question arises of
what to do during the workday with your self-driving car. "Regular" parking
remains an option, but is not free in many downtowns. You could send it to park
elsewhere: perhaps a lot outside of the downtown core or even to your house. Or
you could send it on a trip: circling downtown or on a long loop away and back
in time to take you home.

**Guess 4**: Cities will pass "anti-cruising" laws to keep self-driving cars
from endlessly circling the block, sometimes for hours, waiting for their
passengers.

**Guess 5**: Downtown rush hour traffic will get worse, as many cars will make
two trips (in and out) to the downtown core at each end of the workday, either
to pick up a second passenger for their own trip to work, or to park or loop
outside the downtown core.

## Scenario 3: "Work from Commute"

Since you don't have to be the one driving, could you "work from home" during
your commute? Perhaps this would require re-configuring your car from one with
four seats to a single seat and a flat work surface, but you don't need a
steering wheel so there isn't much (beyond imagination) keeping this from
happening.

**Guess 6**: Self-driving cars will be reconfigured inside to allow other uses,
such as being a mobile office.

Once you have a "mobile office" aka a "work from commuting car", what are the
chances you could convince your boss to count your time traveling (but working)
as part of your 8 hour work shift, effectively reducing how long you're gone
from the house? Or maybe you just work half days in the office, and count your
commuting time without asking your boss.

But taken (literally) a step further, once you have a "working commute", how
long could your commute reasonably be? Two or three hours? At that point, you
could still work half days in the office, with the other half from "at home",
and still not be adding anything to your 8 hour day.

Now you have access to housing far beyond the urban core (up to 300 km/200
miles away?), allowing you to live in rural areas or small towns, presumably
with their lower housing costs, while still having many of the amenities of
urban life (after all, you drive to the "big city" every day.)

**Guess 7**: Some commuters will be able to live considerably further from the
office than today, while still working half days in the office. This may prove
the salvation of some rural areas and small towns.

## Scenario 4: Business Trips

Eventually, some boss is going to look at someone's two to four hour commute,
and ask them if they're willing to drive the *other* way to do a meeting an
another office or a partner's location. What today would require dedicating
three (or more) days and a couple of flights can be done as "just another day
in the office". Or perhaps a boss will work like this, managing two different
locations, in cities up to 8 hours apart, while living halfway between them.

Someone in the accounting department will hear rumour of this, and wonder how
much you can push this. I think the next leap would be overnight trips: hop in
the car after supper and arrive in the new office by mid-morning would give you
a range of about 12 or so hours. At this point, your car would need someplace
for you to sleep, whether a "proper" bed or a reclining chair, and possibly a
toilet or at least a modern take on a slop pail. If the person is high enough
up, they might also be able to demand a shower and a sink to get ready at. The
space may be able to be reconfigurable, so you don't need 4+ rooms. If you add
a kitchen, you would basically have a studio apartment (on wheels!) or a
motorhome.

Now you have access to a huge chunk of the continent as basically "another day
in the office"! For example:

- from Calgary, you could reach Vancouver (10 1/2 hours), Edmonton (3 hours),
  Winnipeg (14 hours), and Salt Lake City (13 hours);
- from Grande Prairie, Alberta, you could reach Yellowknife, Edmonton, Calgary,
  Regina, Great Falls MT, and Vancouver;
- from Chicago, you could reach New York, Washington DC, Atlanta, Oklahoma
  City, Dallas in a pinch, Winnipeg, Ottawa, and Montreal.

**Guess 8**: If another group doesn't first, business travellers will create a
demand for "motorhome" versions of the self-driving car.

**Guess 9**: The relative ease of travel (i.e. you no longer have to sit behind
the wheel) will see increasing numbers of managers and salesmen managing far
flung territories.

## Scenario 5: Life on the Road

So at this point in our thought experiment, we now have self driving
motorhomes. New units will likely be as expensive as today's motorhomes:
starting at $50,000, but rising to $300- or $400,000. Initially this will limit
the market: business executives and traveling salesman (often corporate
bought), and permanent RV-ers. But given a few years, as sales volumes rise and
a used market develops, the entry price may drop.

At the low end of the housing market, buying a (self-driving) motorhome will
also become increasing appealing; after all, the top end (~$400,000) for a
(new) motorhome is still only the average house prices in many of the more
"reasonable" housing markets, to say nothing of the more expensive ones.

**Guess 10:** The relative low cost of self-driving motorohomes, when compared
with other forms of housing in major centers, will lead to a whole class of
"mobile home dwellers," a landless and mobile class.

What is less clear is how society as a whole will respond to a large,
functionally mobile class (let's call them *The Travellers*). There are certain
people that do this today (living out of an RV or a boat), but the change here
is the sheer scale of it. Much of today's society has the implicit assumption
that you have an physical (civil) address that is relatively stable. Perhaps
history will be our guide, and we can look at how the Roma (aka the Gypsies) or
the Irish Travellers have been treated, but neither of those are particularly
heartwarming examples, and neither of them had a strong presence in North America.

**Guess 11:** Having a large, landless, travelling class of people will change
society far more than self-driving cars do directly. How, I'm less sure, so let
me ask some questions:

- How do you get mail? Today, your default mailing address is your
  physical (civil) address. Will a PO box be enough?
- How do you establish (or un-establish) or prove tax residency
  when you're working on the move? Today, many US states expect you to file and
  pay state level income tax if you do any work in their state, but how do they
  go about proving you were in their state when there are no hotel receipts or
  plane tickets to tie you somewhere for the night? I mean, they don't
  currently
  try and claim for work you do as fly over the state....
- Do border crossing change when from the outside someone (in a self-driving
  motorhome) going on vacation and someone working from their RV look much
  alike?
- How do you prove residency for immigration or healthcare or for in-state
  tuition? All of these require that you spend a certain number of days within
  the jurisdiction over years of time.
- How do you establish residency in a local
  neighboorhood to allow your kids to attend the local school?
- When it is census time, where do you get counted?
- How do you establish enough ties to a local riding (or distrcit) to be
  allowed to vote there? Today, I can show up with my driver's license as proof
  that I live in the district, so will this get outsourced to whoever prints up
  your driver's license? Currently, if you're American and you move out of the
  county, you continue to vote in the last district you lived in (inside the
  US); will this be extended to *Travellers*, and you'll vote at your last
  physical address? What happens when you're the child of *Travellers*, and
  have never had a "physical address"?
- What would you put on your security clearance (or immigration) forms when it
  asks you for your address for the last five years? Or your mortgage
  application?
- How does a city change when a huge number of their citizens are landless? Do
  cities build parking spaces for the *Travellers*, and try and attract them?
  Or do they ignore them, and leave them shut out of the political process?
- What happens to the "landed" and their communities? Do land-based communities
  become a new form of a gated community?
- On a personal level, who stops in to check on your "apartment," to discover
  that you died in front of the TV, when you never stop anywhere longer than it
  takes to refuel? Will your motorhome keep driving, potentially for years,
  until your bank account no longer has the funds for the next refueling?

## Conclusion

First order effects are easy enough to guess at, but our society is complex and
varied, and how the "end game" of self-driving cars plays out could result in a
fundamentally different society than the one we assume now.
