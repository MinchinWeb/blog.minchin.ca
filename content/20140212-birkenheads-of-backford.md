I have been continuing my research of the Bunbury line. For the 18th
century and earlier, *Burke's Peerage* has proved incredibly useful. As
*Burke's* is serves mainly for showing how someone inherited their title
or lands, it tends to be patrilinial (meaning descent is calculated
through men). However, the wives are often well noted, including the
wife's father. Such is the link between the Bunbury's and the
Birkenhead's.

> v. [Eleanor](http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I9874.html), *b.* in
> 1605, *m.* to [Thomas](http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I2155.html),
> second son of [Sir Henry Bunbury, of
> Stanney](http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I2156.html).

So this their marriage would fall about 60 years before the Bunbury
family moved from England to Ireland. So I followed up Eleanor's
ancestors and family, and added 100+ Birkenhead's to my family tree. The
Birkenhead's go back to four more generations to [Adam Birkenhead, of
Huxley](http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I10122.html), who lived
during the reigns of King Henry VII and King Henry VIII (Henry VII
reigned from 1485-1509. Henry VIII reigned from 1509-1547.) There is a
note in *Burke's* that Adam Birkenhead "deriv[ed] from John De
Birkenhead, who flourished in the reign of Edward III." Edward III
reigned from 1327 - 1377, so this would push the line back another 150
years or so, but I'll have to find the names in another place.

Interestingly enough, Eleanor's grandmother was [Elizabeth
Bunbury](http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I9867.html), tying back in
to the Bunbury line.
