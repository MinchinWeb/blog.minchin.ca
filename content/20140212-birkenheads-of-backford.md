I have been continuing my research of the Bunbury line. For the 18th century
and earlier, *Burke's Peerage* has proved incredibly useful. As *Burke's* is
serves mainly for showing how someone inherited their title or lands, it tends
to be patrilineal (meaning descent is calculated through men). However, the
wives are often well noted, including the wife's father. Such is the link
between the Bunbury's and the Birkenhead's.

> v. [Eleanor](https://genealogy.minchin.ca/profiles/i9874/), *b.* in 1605,
> *m.* to [Thomas](https://genealogy.minchin.ca/profiles/i2155/), second son
> of [Sir Henry Bunbury, of
> Stanney](https://genealogy.minchin.ca/profiles/i2156/).

So this their marriage would fall about 60 years before the Bunbury family
moved from England to Ireland. So I followed up Eleanor's ancestors and family,
and added 100+ Birkenhead's to my family tree. The Birkenhead's go back to four
more generations to [Adam Birkenhead, of
Huxley](https://genealogy.minchin.ca/profiles/i10122/), who lived during the
reigns of King Henry VII and King Henry VIII (Henry VII reigned from 1485-1509.
Henry VIII reigned from 1509-1547.) There is a note in *Burke's* that Adam
Birkenhead "deriv[ed] from John De Birkenhead, who flourished in the reign of
Edward III." Edward III reigned from 1327 - 1377, so this would push the line
back another 150 years or so, but I'll have to find the names in another place.

Interestingly enough, Eleanor's grandmother was [Elizabeth
Bunbury](https://genealogy.minchin.ca/profiles/i9867/), tying back in to the
Bunbury line.
