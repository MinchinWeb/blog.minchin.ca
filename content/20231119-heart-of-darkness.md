I recently re-read *The Heart of Darkness*, by Joseph Conrad (the last time was
in high school, for English class). I was pleasantly surprised by how short it
was (~90 pages) and delighted by the prose: so much of the "modern" texts I
read are either soulless corporate speak, that say very little, particularly
about the things that actually matter, or flowery advertising speak, that
serves more to misdirect and hide, or bland and flat, by writers who are
exposed to very little soulful writing (or is this a description of my fears of
own writing??). It's hard to tease apart how much is a result of being written
in over a century ago in 1899, how much is the writer displaying his craft, and
how much of the structure is borrowed from Conrad's native Polish.

One example that I particularly liked is the description of sailors, which is
full of emotion and revels in the contradictions it exposes:

> [M]ost seamen lead, if one may so express it, a sedentary life. Their minds
> are of the stay-at-home order, and their home is always with them -- the
> ship; and so is their country -- the sea. One ship is very much like another,
> and the sea is always the same. In the immutability of their surroundings,
> the foreign shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide
> past, veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful
> ignorance; for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea
> itself, which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as destiny.
> For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree on
> shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent, and
> generally he finds the secret not worth knowing.

Here is a group of people that, to those of us who remain on land, we assumed
to live the exact opposite of a "sedentary life[style]", who would seem to be
drawn to the sea for the wonder of far away places, and yet when they are
confronted with them, turn back to their own "small village" of their ship.

And the contradictions run even deeper: this is offered in direct contrast to
our narrator, Marlow, who has the wanderlust to drag him first to the mainland
Europe (from London) and then into the barely explored depths of Africa, out of
a desire to know the unseen, unexplored parts of the map.

I hope to find more beautifully written stories like this soon!
