The on-going adventures that are life....This week is Reading Week,
which means no school (yeah!) for a week, which makes for a great
opportunity to skip town for a little Rest and Relaxation and to make an
attempt to catch up to both life and school. Our ultimate destination
was the Canadian Rockies, but we had an overnight stop in Lethbridge (in
southern Alberta) to pick up a friend (who happens to live in an
all-girl arrangement). At first I figured I could just call up another
friend and crash on a couch, but that didn’t pan out – a combination of
not knowing as many people as I thought I did in town and several of
those who I did know having decided to skip town for the weekend (crazy
idea, I know...). Plan B, then, was buck up and drop the hundred bucks
and get a motel room. Plan B, however, had one major miscalculation –
this was the night of February 14th, and EVERYTHING in town was taken;
we drove around for an hour and even the places we were told to avoid
like the plague had pulled out their “No Vacancy” signs. In the end, we
parked near where we needed to be in the morning, pulled out the long
underwear and winter coats, and hunkered down in the van for the night,
running it off and on to stay warm. So the moral of this adventure:
