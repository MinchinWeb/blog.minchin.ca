Life feels like it's returning to normal. But I wonder if that's mostly because
the kids are back at school and my Honey is once again working outside the
house (so I have the house to myself during the day again).

In other, somewhat surprising news, we bought a new house! It seems somewhat
ironic that it would happen during these Covid times, but here we are.
Actually, we've done rather well though this Covid spell so far: my work was
unaffected, my Honey was off work but the government programs more than made up
for her lost paycheck, plus no childcare to pay for and nowhere to travel to.
We'd been looking at houses for some time (perhaps 3 years?) and so when
something came up that we knew was a great combination of the price and the
location we were after, we knew it was time to jump. It ended up happening
really fast. I'm still surprised it happened (as recently as January, I figured
it would never happen due to housing prices...). Even more surprising, we were
able to do it without increasing our monthly mortgage payment, although we did
add another 12 years until our mortgage will be paid off.
