Tonight I was after a nighttime theme again. If you point your camera at
the stars and leave the shutter open long enough, you end up with these
cool star trails. The problem with these pictures is they take a LONG
time. The next one in the set (7 minute exposure) got 'ruined' because
the clouds rolled in and covered the stars. At that point, I decided I'd
better call it a night.

I'll keep playing with it and see what I can come up with...
