During
my
travels through Normandy, I began to wonder how it was that Normandy and
Britain ended up both with Lions for symbols. In Eu, on the Normandy
coast
where William the Conquerer was married, I found the link. I was told
that the
animals are no lions, but leopards, and England uses three, Normandy was
given
the right to use two by the English crown, and that Eu (a town on the
Normandy coast that was the site of William's marriage) was offered the
right to
use one by Normandy.

Why the leopard? I wondered how a lion could end
up a symbol of a place far removed from the native home and the fact
that it's
a leopard doesn't offer any answers. As it turns out, the leopard was an
animal
that has been known since antiquity, even in regions far from its
natural
realm, as a hunter noted from its skill and stealth. Anciently (and into
the
Middle Ages), the leopard was considered to be the offspring of the
adulterous
union of a lioness and a pard, a mythical animal. (and since I learnt
that, I
struggle not to call the animal a *leo pard*, as to rhyme with
leotards) Thus the mane on the leopard that often gets it confused with
the
lion and sometimes used interchangeably with the lion. Thus in heraldry,
the
leopard was sometimes used as a symbol when the first to bear the arms
in
question was the product of an adulterous relationship himself. Thus,
Richard
the Lionhearted, King of England and Duke of Normandy, may have making
reference to his Grandfather, William the Conquerer who was also known
as
William the Bastard (what a name!) in choosing the three leopards we now
recognize as a symbol of the English crown.

### Update (November 17, 2010)

Unfortunately, the story refuses to stay so simple. Two facts
come to the surface:

-   King Richard was the first to use (at least that we have record 
    of) three 'lions' for a symbol of the English crown and thus for
    England. This
    was on his great seal, created in 1198 after he returned from
    captivity in
    Germany.

-   Heraldry, as we know it, wasn't defined and formalized until the
    12<sup>th</sup>
    century in England.

The combination of the two basically means
that anything that happened before Richard's seal was outside the bounds
and
rules of 'modern' heraldry. Richard may well have picked their lions
because he
thought they looked good together and for no deeper reason.

Another theory advanced goes back to Rollo (c.
870 -- c. 932), the original 'Northman' that laid siege to Paris in 885
and was
thus given Normandy by the French king Charles the Simple. Rollo was
said to
bare a leopard as his standard. A second was added when the county of
Maine was
annexed into Normandy. The third was added by King Henry II of England
upon his
marriage to Eleanor of Aquitain as a single lion was the symbol of
Aquitain.
Their son was Richard whose great seal we mentioned earlier.

Another possibility is simply that the
three lions were pleasing to the eyes and were chosen for no greater
reason. (If
you're the king, who's really going to tell you 'no'?)
