*Wednesday, April 29, 2009*

Woke up this morning, ate breakfast, and then hit the road, with the
goal being Las Vegas, Nevada, and I figure I'll make stops in Fort Cole,
St. George, Utah and at Hoover Dam.

Civilization petered out pretty quickly after Provo, but southern Utah
still doesn't seem nears as empty as Montana. The traffic never really
disappeared, which makes me wonder where they all could be going. My
first stop was Old Fort Cole, located just off the junction of I-15 and
I-70. President Hickley's grandfather built it at the request of Brigham
Young, and it served as a way-point for both travellers (who would be 30
miles on a good day, in contrast with my 700...) and the telegraph. It
had been recommended to stop into Zion National Park a couple of times,
but it's about an hour off the road, so I decided to pass, and I'll have
to do that another day. I stopped in St. George for several hours. I was
trying to find a car remote for my iPod, and I found something at the
local Best Buy that would have probably worked well, but I couldn't get
it to turn on, and ended up returning it, and so I lost about an hour
there. I also stopped in at the St. George Temple vistor's center. The
Temple, at 175 feet tall, is a massive structure in a town of this size!
I stopped in Mesquite for supper at the Virgin River Casino (I'd been
seeing their billboards all day driving out of Utah) -- the price ($5)
was right but the food was nothing to brag about, so next time I'll go
somewhere else! Soon after leaving Mesquite, my low fuel light came on.
The next two exits looked pretty empty, and so I didn't pull off until I
got to North Las Vegas, with my fuel gauge just above the fumes line
(add a little adventure to the night, right? :-) ). The thing that
amazed me about Vegas is how big the city is. You come over a hill as
you come in from the north, and all of a sudden the city is spread
beneath you and the lights seems to cover the whole panorama. The hotels
on the Strip are enormous -- they all seem to be skyscrapers! You begin
to wonder which has more high-rises -- all of Edmonton or the Las Vegas
Strip... I got a room on the Strip at the Tropicana, and felt too tired
to go out and do much. I guess I'll know for next time -- if I really
want to see Vegas, I need more than one night; the first will get eaten
up in just getting settled in.
