## Act of Remembrance

*They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:*  
*Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.*  
*At the going down of the sun and in the morning,*  
*We will remember them.*

*We will remember them.*

## Remembrance Day, 2023

This year, Remembrance Day fell on a Saturday. The weather was surprisingly
warm for November, and I wanted to attend a Remembrance Day ceremony with the
little ones in person (the last few years, we've watched the National ceremony
from Ottawa at home on the couch).

I was disappointed to discover that the indoor ceremony that I'd previously
attended wasn't happening (and I guess hasn't since Covid first became a
thing). Of course, we didn't discover this until we were physically standing
there, wondering where everyone else was, at 10:30am. Per online, it looked
like there was a ceremony to start shortly at the Provincial Legislature, so we
quickly headed down. On the lawn we found the military set up for the gun (or
cannon!) salute, but no ceremony. We did eventually find (in time!) a ceremony
on the upper plaza. I gather, however, that the Legislature's "official"
ceremony had been the day before. It was good to be there, and I hope the
little ones gained something from it too.

I wonder a lot how the little ones, growing up now, will relate to Remembrance
Day. When I was a kid in school, the World War II veterns were old but still
alive; they could come talk to us and tell of something of their experiences.
Today, the youngest of them must be approaching 100, and they will all soon be
gone. There have been wars to produce veterns since -- Korea, Bosnia,
Afghanistan, and others -- but not in the numbers of the World Wars to lend to
the commonality of the experience, both among young men and among the
community. Perhaps this (familiarity with war venterns) will be another thing
lost as the era of a "common popular culture" dissolves.

To me, Remembrance Day is a connection to the past. It is a reminder that
"freedom isn't free"; that sometimes the peacable need to bring others in line
at the point of a sword. It is a reminder not to take our freedoms for granted.
It is also a community event, and community ritual; there are so few things we
do as a larger community these days.

## Parts of a Remembrance Day Ceremony

In case Remembrance Day ceremonies fade even more, it seems perhaps wise to
note the pieces that make up a ceremony.

The traditional date to hold the service is November 11th. If held another date
(if, for example, November 11th is a holiday or on the weekend and you're doing
this at a workplace or scholl), hold it beforehand but as close to the 11th as
reasonable.

Those participating are invited to wear a poppy, attached to their left breast
of their clothing. A poppy is traditionally worm from the beginning of November
until the 11th.

If held municipally, the local cenotaph is the most appropriate location. If
needed, a temporary cenotaph may be erected for the service.

Before the service proper, sentries may be plated at the cenotaph. They should
be in place from before the service begins until after the service is complete.

Larger services will include a parade, bringing military units participating to
the service. I've always particularly enjoyed hearing the pipe (i.e. bagpipes)
and drums bands.

There are often some opening remarks, recognition of dignitaries, and signing
of the national anthem.

Finally, the heart of the service itself. In my mind, in a pinch, the service
could be trimmed down to just this, and even then the wreaths could be
optional.

1.  Last Post

    The *Last Post* is played on a bugle (or a trumpet), and was traditionally
    played at the end of the day. Here, is it a symbol of death.

2.  A Moment of Silence

    2 minutes long, starting at 11 o'clock. Ideally, starting exactly at the
    top of the hour.

3.  Lamant

    The *Lament* is played on bagpipes.

4.  Rouse

    The *Rouse* is played again on a bugle, and was traditionally played to
    wake soldiers at the start of the day.

5.  The Act of Remembrance

    This is the poem at the top of this article. Some of what I've read online
    suggests that it should be read by a veteran, where possible. The last line
    above (*We will remember them*) is actually a reply of those present to the
    end of the poem.

6.  Placing of Wreaths

    Wreaths are laid at the foot of the memorial. In larger ceremonies, the
    wreath is carried by a member of the miliary, who advances with the
    wreath-layer to the memorial, who then lays the wreath.

Following the formal wreaths, it has emerged as a folk tradition to lay one's
poppy at the memorial too.

And thus the service finishes.

*We will remember them.*

World War II, during a recent (summer 2022) visit.*
