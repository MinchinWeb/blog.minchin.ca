Further along the Pacific Coast Highway I came across a lighthouse, just
before dusk. Perhaps it comes from my growing up far from the ocean, but
I've always been fascinated with lighthouses and the lighthouse as a
symbol in the way they stand as a sentinel and unmoved, regardless of the
storm they brews around them.
