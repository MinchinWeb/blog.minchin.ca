I was looking up ACSII art on
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii_art) the other day and I
came across this, which is too funny to pass up. Who says stickmen can't
dance? Here's the Macarena!

```text
  o      o     o    o     o    <o     <o>    o>    o
 .|.    \|.   \|/   //    X     \      |    <|    <|>
  /\     >\   /<    >\   /<     >\    /<     >\   /<
```

Too funny!
