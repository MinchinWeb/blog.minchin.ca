Still in Paris, I've always been fascinated with the Metro system. It
proves to be a difficult place to take pictures because the light levels
are so low (I guess what should I expect from an underground tunnel?)
and you're typically moving. Rather than fight it, I figured out how to
make it work for me! This picture is taken using a longer shutter speed
and the few lights in the tunnel (mostly emergency lighting and traffic
control, I presume) plus the movement of the train to get the light
streams. Enjoy!
