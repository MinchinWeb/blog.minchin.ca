This is the castle sitting on the cliffs, overlooking the sea and
standing guard over Dieppe. When the city was walled, the castle had a
prominent place in the wall. Today, the walls are gone (save one gate
only) leaving the castle.\

[From Wikipedia](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Dieppe):

> </p>
> The exact origin of the castle is [somewhat] confusing, [but] it was
> certainly built on the site of an earlier castle, built by Henry II
> and Richard the Lion Heart [of England et al.], then destroyed by
> Philippe Auguste [of France] in 1195. ... The site was restored in the
> 14th century. The castle was later in large part reconstructed in 1433
> by Charles des Marets.

>
> The town walls were built around 1360. ... Although the town was
> largely destroyed by an Anglo-Dutch naval bombardment in 1694, the
> castle survived.\
> \

> <p>
> The castle was classified as a *Monument historique* [Historical
> Monument] in 1862. ... It was bought by the town in 1903 and today is
> home to the Dieppe museum with its collection of ivories, maritime
> exhibits and the papers and belongings of Camille Saint-Saëns.

Taking a photo of the castle is a little tricky because the sky (the
background), even when cloudy, is surprisingly bright. Thus, if the
camera isn't set right, the detail of the colour of the castle is either
washed out or covered in darkness.
