I read an article about a week ago describing it as [a
disgrace](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122584386627599251.html), how
Bush has been treated by the American people and media. I sat back and
realized it's been a LONG time since I've heard anything nice about
George W. Bush. Regardless of how good a job Bush did, or did not do,
when the American media starts bad-mounthing the President, it
implicitly gives everyone else permission to due the same.

Whether or not you like Obama and his policies, I think part of the hope
he offers America is that the media has treated him very well, both
domestic and international. There is thus hope that the international
media will have positive things to say about this new American
president, and by extension, the country as a whole. America remains a
force to be reckoned with, and it does no one a disservice to recognize
the role American has, and can, play on the world stage to resolve the
issues that effect us all.
