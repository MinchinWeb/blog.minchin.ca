*Tuesday, April 28, 2009*

Today was pretty quiet, as I just hung around Provo. I caught up to a
couple of friends, and looked into a Grad program at the university in
town. The program seems a good fit, and they surprised me when they told
me if I can get my application put together in the next two weeks, I can
get in for the fall! I'm excited, but it's no easy task that's been put
before me. I guess when I find someplace with a phone and the internet,
I'll have to spend some time figuring it all out. The goal for tomorrow
is Vegas!

(I exchanged some Canadian money for American, and the exchange rate I
got was 78 cents, so that's what I'm using -- at least for now -- for the
conversion factor between the two.)

Provo (all day) (lunch ~$7)

*Today -- US$7 -- 0 hours -- 0km*
***Total -- CAD$231.87 -- 16:40 hours -- 1712km***
