#### Abstract

</p>
Toronto has achieved a unique situation in North America; it is a major
city that has maintained a dense core of population and employment with
a well-functioning public transit system. This combination has made
Toronto one of the most liveable cities on the continent. This is a
result of years of deliberate decisions to integrate land-use and
transportation planning, through policies such as zoning and parking
controls, promoting public transportation and bicycle use, and limiting
freeway construction.\

A review of the various policies implanted, as well as their effects
where appropriate, is presented, along with conclusions about what has
brought Toronto success and how that can be repeated elsewhere.\

#### Introduction

</p>
Toronto (see FIGURE 1), with a population of 2.5 million
([***[1]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn1)),
is the capital of the province of Ontario and the largest city in
Canada. Toronto also lies at the center of the “Golden Horseshoe”, an
area which encircles the western end of Lake Ontario, which has a
population of 8 million, or a quarter of the Canadian
population ([***[2]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn2)).
Toronto is a vibrant city with a rich history of public transportation,
with some private streetcars operating as early as
1850 ([](https://draft.blogger.com/null)[***[3]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn3)).
The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), established in 1954, operates the
third busiest public transit system in North America (after New York
City and Mexico City), carrying [2.5 million passengers a
day](https://draft.blogger.com/null) (*[3]*). Toronto operates three
subway lines, and Light Rail Transit (LRT) lines, streetcars, and a
fleet of buses (*[3]*).  Toronto has been able to maintain a relatively
dense core and impressive transit service over the years. A literature
review was performed to determine some of the causes, particularly land
use policies implemented, that have allowed Toronto to maintain such a
strong public transit system. Conclusions and observations were also
drawn on how the success of Toronto may be replicated elsewhere.\

</p>
#### The Planning Process

</p>
In short, land-use planning is the process where a municipality
determines how land will be used within the region. In modern planning
(post World War II), this process was fordist in nature, suggesting that
land uses should be separated, and with a disregard for the past
conventions such as mixed use developments and close integration of
residential and employment, viewing these as out of touch with current
desires and
needs ([](https://draft.blogger.com/null)[***[5]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn5)).
The time period following World War II saw a great increase in
factories, typically large, spread-out, single story structures, and it
was typically expected that governments would act as enablers, providing
the zoning required and housing (typically single family housing) nearby
for the factory workers (*[5]*). Of this mentality, Newman and Kenwothy
note:\

> </p>
>  “One of the features of 20th century modernism is functional
> isolation: architects, for example, believed that they could ‘make a
> statement’ with their buildings as though they did not relate to an
> urban context with a history or a local community.\
>
> \
>
> <p>
> “The same can be said about transport planning in its modernist phase
> which has been touched by a similar kind of arrogance. The civil
> engineer or economist who became a transport planner tended to see
> transport as isolated patterns of origins and destinations which were
> floating entities to be joined up by a straight line and be as fast
> moving as possible.”
> ([](https://draft.blogger.com/null)[***[6]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn6),
> p. 1)

</p>
\

Toronto initially started down this course of fordist development, but a
turning point came as the result of public opposition to and the
eventually cancellation in 1971 of the Spadina
Expressway ([***[7]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn7)).

</div>

</p>
A key figure in this movement was Jane Jacobs, who had recently moved to
Toronto from Manhattan. Jacobs was active in opposing those projects
which she saw as detrimental to a neighbourhood’s character, and
eventually published *The Death and Life of American Cities* in 1961
which served to challenge much of the conventional wisdom of the time
regarding land-use and city planning. Part of what set her book apart
was that Jacobs did more than just criticize, but proposed an alternate
model. In *Death and Life*, she makes four recommendations:\

-   A street or district must serve several primary functions,
-   Blocks must be short,
-   Buildings must vary in age, condition, use and rentals, and
-   Populations must be dense
    ([***[9]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn9)).

</p>
Jacobs and her ideas remained influential in the planning process taking
place in Toronto, and so rather than the expressway, a subway line was
built. Today, many of the results of this change in attitude can be seen
– within metropolitan Toronto, 35 percent of peak trips are on public
transit and 65 percent of trips to the central area are handled by the
Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and GO Transit (a regional rail
commuter system operated by the province of Ontario). Indeed, no major
roads have been built within the central areas since the Gardiner
Expressway and the Don Valley Parkway were linked in 1966. Stewart and
Pringle further note that over the last 30 years, automobile traffic
volumes have remained stable despite a near doubling of office space
within the central
area ([](https://draft.blogger.com/null)[***[10]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn10)).\

#### Historical City Design

</p>
To understand how the urban form within Toronto has been shaped over the
last decades, it will be useful to review the history and evolution of
the layout of a city. Newman and Kenworthy make a note of three
predominate forms: the traditional walking city, a city with tram-based
suburbs, and the automobile based city form. What ties the three
together is that, in general, people do not like to travel more than 30
minutes to their urban destination (*[6]*).\

##### The Traditional Walking City

</p>
The traditional walking city was the first city form to emerge, as much
as 10,000 years ago. The primary mode of transportation was by foot, and
so as such, cities were rarely more than 5 km across. Densities were
often high – as much as 100 to 200 people per hectare (*[6]*). FIGURE 3
shows a typical layout of a traditional walking city.\

</p>
##### Tram-Based Suburbs

</p>
In the early 19^th^ century, the invention and implementation of rail
based urban travel, in such forms as trams and streetcars, allowed for
the development of more remote ‘suburbs.’ Activities would typically
concentrate at railway stations or along tram lines. Most systems were
radial in nature and so the central city remained the hub of economic
activity. This allowed the city to spread to 20-30 km with lower
densities (50-100 people per hectare) (*[6]*). FIGURE 4 shows a typical
layout for a city that has developed into tram based suburbs.\

</p>
##### Automobile Based Suburbs

</p>
Although automobile based suburbs first came into existence before World
War II, their development was greatly magnified afterwards. With the
private automobile, the space between the radial arms of the rail
network were filled in with low density, automobile based activities,
and then the development continued outward, as far as 50 km from the
city center. Density was also low, typically 10-20 people per
hectare (*[6]*). FIGURE 5 shows the typical layout of a city that has
grown from a tram based suburbs to automobile based suburbs.\

</p>
##### Toronto’s Application

</p>
Toronto initially developed based on the walking city model and then
progressed to a city with tram-based suburbs. What makes Toronto unique
among North American cities is that it has maintained much of the
character of the tram-based suburbs and has continued to grow in this
fashion (*[6]*).\

Toronto has employed four strategies in particular to this end. The
first was a suburban density formula seeking to confine high density
developments (particularly high-rise apartments which were constructed
in great numbers during the 1950’s to 1970’s) to arterials, on the logic
that these arterials provided the best access for these residents to
major bus routes with low headways already serving these corridors. The
second strategy was to align density with transportation. Indeed, it was
accepted that with high density redevelopment along proposed subway
lines, this new development could provide enough ridership alone to
justify the construction of the line in question. The third and fourth
strategies, developed later, were those of nodal development, and “main
street” corridors. Nodal development was suggested in part to relieve
the strangling transportation congestion that had developed as a result
of employment concentration in downtown Toronto, and create nodes
further afield that would provide a concentration of employment, housing
and commercial activities to be amenable to good public transit service.
The fourth development technique, that of “main streets” corridors,
sought to redevelop corridors of single story commercial development
with buildings of three to six stories in height with commercial at the
street level with residential
above ([](https://draft.blogger.com/null)[***[12]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn12)).\

These various techniques have had limited success, as they have run into
a number of “real world” conditions such as a drop off of high-rise
construction in the 1970’s to provide high density redevelopment,
concerns of Not In My BackYard (NIMBY) in reaction to redevelopment
programs, and a stagnation of public transportation funding for many
years. However, North York Center has developed along the node ideal,
achieving over 20 percent public transportation share, while Scarborough
Towne Centre approaches that level. The ‘main street’ model, while yet
to be well received in the inner suburb areas, has been applied well in
principal within the center of Toronto and inner city areas (*[12]*).\

#### Toronto by the Statistics

</p>
Toronto, because of the choices it has made since World War II, has
developed into a much different city than the typical American city.
Kenworthy and Laube performed several comparisons, based on 1990 data,
and found that Toronto, compared to the average ‘American’ city, has
about 3 times the density (41 people per hectare, versus 14 in the
United States), a third the road supply per capita, significantly less
parking downtown (176 parking spaces per 1000 jobs within the Central
Business District (CBD) versus 462), and nearly four times the transit
service (106 km of service per capita per year versus
28) ([***[13]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn13)).
The numbers show what can be confirmed through observations – while most
American cities have developed around their freeway systems, Toronto has
forgone freeway-based development in favour of an approach that has seen
public transit be successful within the greater Toronto region.\

#### Transportation Policy in Toronto

</p>
Although not formalized until 1976, many policies promoting public
transit, or at least discouraging Single Occupancy Vehicles (SOV’s)
within Toronto had been introduced in the two decades previous. Stewart
and Pringle note that not many official Traffic Demand Management (TDM)
measures have been introduced, in part because of the lack of a
perceived problem, such as particularly bad traffic congestion, poor air
quality, or a fossil fuel shortage (*[9]*). Toronto has sought to
maintain and increase the housing supply within the central area of the
city, as well as maintain employment concentration. Thus, many people
can live very close to work, reducing the number of trips needed and
their length. Indeed, it has been noted by Frank and Pivo that increased
work density does more to reduce trip length than increased housing
density ([***[14]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn14)).
One of the landmark studies on housing in the central area of Toronto is
Nowlan and Stewart in which they found that for every 100 additional
dwelling units in the central area of Toronto, there has been a
reduction of 120 inbound trips during the morning rush
hour ([***[15]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn15)).
Based on this, Stewart and Pringle postulate that if a housing unit were
added for each additional 30 m^2^ of office space, there would be no net
change in inbound peak-period trips (*[9]*).\

Zoning and parking requirement laws were also revised, and the old
requirement of one parking spot per 93 m^2^ of office area was repealed
and replaced with a new requirement of one space per 300 m^2^ of floor
space and a maximum of one space per 135 m^2^ of floor space (*[9]*).
When the Skydome, the new stadium for the professional baseball team,
the Toronto Blue Jays, was completed, a downtown location was selected
that would allow it to easily access public transportation. The stadium,
which seats 54,000 spectators, is linked by a pedway to Union Station,
which provides both subway and GO Transit service. The stadium itself
has only 500 parking spaces on site with the intention that parking from
nearby office towers could be utilized during the evenings and weekends,
which is when most of the Blue Jay’s games are played.\

As an extension to zoning requirements, in 1991, the City of Toronto
introduced a requirement for Environmental Service Plans of all new
developments, which must include TDM plans for any new commercial
development with more than 75 parking spaces. This too has served to
reduce travel demand by an estimated 25 percent when such plans have
been implemented (*[9]*).\

Significant to maintaining liveability, Toronto has not built any new
freeways in the central area since 1966, although several subway lines
have been completed. This is in part due to very few corridors still
existing which can be such developed. The freeway system within Toronto,
however, is substantial, with parts of Highway 401 through downtown
Toronto expanding to 18 lanes in parts, with an Annual Average Daily
Traffic volume (AADT) in excess of 500,000 between Weston Road and
Highway
400 ([***[16]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn16)).
Toronto has, however, seen the construction of Highway 407 to the north
of the central area. This road is built as a toll road and serves to
bypass traffic from the core area of the city to the north.\

Toronto has also sought to promote cycling. All major commercial
developments are required to provide bicycle parking and shower and
change facilities for cyclists. Toronto has also improved its cycle
network. The result has been an increase of 75 percent in bicycle
traffic between 1987 and 1993 (*[9]*).\

#### Application

</p>
The next step is to analyze what Toronto has applied and see if it has
application elsewhere. On this matter, Knight and Trygg note that
significant development has occurred around many of the stations in
Toronto, but that much of this is the result of a combined focus of
“aggressive zoning, joint public/private development, and, in general,
carefully coordinated transit and land-use
development” ([***[17]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn17)).
This should provide encouragement to those jurisdictions that are
contemplating transit based decisions in land-use planning, but should
serve as a warning against half-hearted efforts.\

In general, regarding TDM plans, Apogee Research has noted that:\

> </p>
> <p>
> “...attempts to change or reduce travel [must be made] by changing
> fundamental conditions influencing travel – how often one must go to
> work or the distances between dwelling places, work places, and other
> destinations – not by trying to change travel under existing
> conditions. As such, they require more fundamental changes in people's
> life styles than merely changing from one vehicle to
> another.” ([***[18]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn18),
> p. 45)

</p>
\

As a general principal, Kaufmann and Jemelin note that:\

> </p>
> <p>
> “Numerous studies have demonstrated the correlation between available
> public transportation, the road network (infrastructure and parking
> facilities) and the location of the activities of residents in urban
> areas (Kaufmann 2000, Pharoah & Apel 1995, Wegener and Fürst 1999).
> The obvious conclusion is that any attempt to encourage modal split
> must take these three factors into account. Notably, an attempt to
> change transport alone by increasing the available public
> transportation, carefully allocating the use of city roads and
> controlling parking facilities is ineffectual if the city is being
> built around road networks located on the
> outskirts.” ([***[19]***](https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=26967745#_edn19),
> p. 295)

</p>
\

Thus, in attempting to repeat the success Toronto has found elsewhere,
it should be remembered that Toronto’s efforts are the results of many
years of dedication to the goal of a multimodal transportation system
and a liveable city, and that the efforts have been made have included
more than just transportation policy or land-use policy in isolation.\

#### Conclusions

</p>
Toronto has achieved a unique situation in North America – it is a major
city that has maintained a dense core of population and employment and a
well-functioning public transit system, and thus is one of the most
liveable cities on the continent. This has been accomplished through
years of deliberate decisions to integrate land-use and transportation
planning with policies such as limiting freeway construction, zoning
regulations and parking controls, and promoting transit and bicycle use.
There is nothing unique about Toronto that keeps these lessons from
being applied elsewhere, but it has been noted the need for both long
term vision and dedication to that vision are required to bring it to
fruition.\

#### Epilogue

</p>
After I completed this paper, I came across *[The Big
Move](http://www.metrolinx.com/thebigmove/index.html)*. *The Big Move*
exemplifies what has made public transportation work in Toronto for all
these years – it covers the region (now Greater Toronto all the way out
to Hamilton), has committed funding from the provincial government, and
has reasonable but daring goals. The plan makes it exciting to see what
will evolve in the public transit sphere for the next 20 years in
Toronto and area.\
