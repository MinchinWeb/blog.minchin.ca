It's amazing how much my telephoto lens lets me zoom in. The flip side
is you have to hold VERY still to get good pictures because the zoom
magnifies every little movement you make when holding the camera.

This is uncropped, of the plugin about 4 feet from where I was sitting.
The orange-ish hue is a result of the low lighting.
