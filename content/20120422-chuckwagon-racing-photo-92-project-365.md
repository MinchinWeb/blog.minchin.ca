This is the event that brought us to Ponoka for the Stampede. Chuckwagon
racing involves watch eight thoroughbred horses (four with the wagon and
four outriders) fly through the "Half Mile of Hell" -- a figure eight in
the infield and then around the track.

When it comes to photography, getting a good picture gets tricky due to
the speed of the racers and the chaos of of the start as the four teams
let loose.
