School projects make for interesting things to post. This time, it’s the
presentation from a class I took in traffic modelling. I started playing
with the images I wanted to use in PowerPoint and I realized that it
would probably be easier (and more fun) to just put everything into a
video! So I played my in-class presentation from YouTube! The
presentation is on the junction of Highway 14 and the Anthony Henday
(Highway 216) on the southeast corner of Edmonton.\

For the technical side, the video was put together using Microsoft
PhotoStory 3 for the image sequences, the base map put together of
screenshots from Google Maps in Adobe Photoshop, the music videos pulled
from YouTube, and everything put together in Windows Movie Maker 2.6.
I’m a little disappointed in the quality of the YouTube video, but I’m
not sure how much of that to blame on the export settings I used in
Movie Maker and how much is YouTube’s compression. Truth be told, it
doesn't look too bad at this size (as above).\

The simulation was completed in VISSIM 5.10 using many of the built-in
parameters, traffic volumes provided by Alberta Transportation’s 2008
manual turning movement counts (i.e. real world data), but I set the
speed distribution to (cumulative) 35% slower than 100km/h, 65% slower
than 110km/h, and 85% slower than 130km/h. I suppose I could play with
VISSIM to get nicer output, but even if it reminds me of a ten year old
video game, it’s fun to think I made it!\

Many pleasant trails to you!
