I couple of days ago I got an email from the [CIRA](http://www.cira.ca)
announcing their ["Tell Us Your dot CA
Story"](http://communications.cira.ca/en/View.aspx?id=71084&q=56765290&qz=7b1ce4)
contest. At first I brushed it off thinking "I have no chance of
winning", but I decided, on second thought, to write something because I
wouldn't mind a new computer, and I figured it would make a good post.
Looking at it now, I think it's probably good enough to end up on my
"[About Me](http://www.minchin.ca/about.htm)" page on my site! My entry:

> [Minchin.ca](http://www.minchin.ca/index.htm) is **my presence** on
> the web. Subtitled "There's lots of random stuff on the web...and some
> of it is even worthwhile! (plus some personal ramblings)", it is a
> space that is all my own, that I can do with as I wish. I think we all
> yearn for a quiet spot that can be uniquely personal, which is what I
> have found in this little piece of cyberspace. Minchin.ca has also
> given me **a platform** ([my blog](http://blog.minchin.ca/)) to
> express myself, share of the wonders I find on the World Wide Web, and
> interact with friends old and new. I enjoy writing, but get to do so
> little creative writing in my school work and personal life that my
> blog has become a wonderful release. In an ever more competitive
> world, **the ability to communicate** becomes of increasing value, and
> it has become a skill that I have thus been able to develop in my
> personal time. My website has also given me the space to post [my
> resume](http://www.minchin.ca/resume.htm) online, and get **a leg up
> on job hunting**. Minchin.ca has provided me with a place to **share
> of [my family history](http://www.minchin.ca/genhome.htm)**, and in
> the process learn more about myself. Along the way, my audience and I
> have found each other. Some are old friends, and some are new, and
> some wish to remain unknown, but each of them has an effect on me.
> They serve to offer new ideas, challenge my views, and demand that I
> stay honest with and to myself. In short, my little presence on the
> web has become **an extension of who I am**.
