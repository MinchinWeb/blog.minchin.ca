When I was home to my parents' last time, I was going through some old
boxes and found this. The album must be nearly as old as I am. The
writing is in my grandma's own hand, which is fitting because it was her
that carried Sinnamon as a maiden name. The passage reads:

> The Sinnamons are descendants from the family of St. Amond who were
> Huguenots (French Protestants) in Europe. In the 16th and 17th century
> [sic] when the Huguenots were persecuted, some of them fled to the
> northern part of Ireland for refuge. At that time, the St. Amonds were
> illiterate. Later, when they learned to read and write, the name was
> written down as SINNAMON
