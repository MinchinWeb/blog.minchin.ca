"Genius! Pure genius!" was my first thought when I stumbled across this
website.

## The Problem

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->'

I go to the store. They say I get a discount if I have their club card.
So some paperwork and five minutes later, I have a 2" by 4" hunk of
plastic and more $10 in my pocket than I otherwise would have. But now
what do I do with it? I already have a collection of similar hunks of
plastic, making my wallet too fat. My option is to keep them somewhere
other than my wallet, inevitably, when I want it next, I won't have it
and will be out $10.

## The Solution -- [Just One Club Card.com](http://www.justoneclubcard.com/)

In reality, most of the time, all you really need at the store is your
card number, and so what Blended Technologies has done is put up a
simple website that allows you to create a double sided card that
contains up to 8 of those bar codes. So what am I doing tonight?
Throwing seven cards from my wallet into the archive folder and
replacing them with one new card! Many major club cards are listed, and
there's an option to add additional bar codes (handy for things like
library cards). As a bonus, check out [the
sleeve](http://www.justoneclubcard.com/JOCC%20SLEEVE.pdf) he's designed
to make it simple for the store clerk to figure out which barcode to
swipe.

I think this is diet we can all stick to!
